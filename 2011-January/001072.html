<PRE>First, i have uploaded unified grass.png. I'm still not entirely pleased 
with it, but its only a few kilobytes... couldn't churgle (perhapse I 
shouldn't use slang) sourceforge too much.

The old greens for the game were interesting.... by the scale, they were 
2 or 3 feet tall and could be used to injure people, but perhaps its 
good if people could see them, opposed to a more traditional grain map 
used by older systems.

'Scale Forgiveness' might be a good term for it.

Luckily I am set up to make it again. I made a GIMP brush that has a few 
dozen grass blades on it, and its suprisingly effective, give or take. 
Worst case, I'll take the time to make a full color GIMP brush, which 
may come in handier in the future.


As for farms, my dad taught me &quot;One acre is enough to feed a man for a 
year&quot;.  There is 640 acres to the mile,  which is (1.6^(0-1))^2)*640 = 
250 acres to the square kilometre. Rather handy number...

The acre includes vegetables, potatoes, wheat, yada yada, and livestock.

If its relevant, a metre is about what it takes to feed a family for a 
day on vegan food. Theres about 4,000 meters in the acre... huh... I'm 
getting some huge numbers here...

A simple number is 100 square metres to the fed year vegan.

Just in case you wish to incorporate it into your game.




I'll spare the math, but apparently, we have enough mass of natural 
heavy hydrogen to power the earth populous for as long as the sun will 
burn and more.

Big numbers are disturbing.


So, maybe the game could also have the goal of fusion power. In real 
life, we could put the plants underwater to reabsorb neutrons, but that 
would be bloody complicate the game.


I better get back to shooping before I brick my computer or something. 
Or brick myself.




Back to the initial topic, the grassland... what do you honestly 
thing... The original was probably better eh?

Hmmm... keeping the original grass might be an idea.


I dont personaly think humanity will make it to fusion before we go back 
to stone and wood VIA fusion, but then again, I don't like the metric 
system hehehe...

I figure people would rather know than not, but I don't know squat about 
that.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Enclosed is concept.jpg.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is an image dedicated to an idea I have about low-technology
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> residential housing. Presently, it is straw roofs with plank walls.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I saw your other draft, and find it very nice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am entirely willing to completely spearhead the graphics effort,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though there must be discussion on the topic.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As it was said, I am not skilled in programming, and any significant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> skill could take months, even with my fastest means of learning,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tinkering with open source scripts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In this sense, I not just want to help, but enjoy work in graphics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is the instances, but the later is alot of work. The first is a re
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> skin of all objects to have a central theme, which would only imply a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change of image objects.
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds great, but i have no idea of the amount of work to achieve 
</I>&gt;<i> this, probably a lot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The second is tying a greater number of objects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the technology level, with progression.
</I>&gt;<i> All buildings take into account the tech_level at build time (for 
</I>&gt;<i> production, pollution ...) but it is not visible in the graphic.
</I>&gt;<i> Having at least 2 kind of each building would make this much easier.
</I>&gt;<i> (and for each bulding there is animation linked to production...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The third is, with a change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of interface, many levels of housing, each with different population
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maximums, according to age...
</I>&gt;<i> Currently there are 6 type of houses (3 low tech and 3 high tech) and 
</I>&gt;<i> i find it complicate enough (maybe too much).  I dont think we need 
</I>&gt;<i> neither more houses nor more complicated rules to manage them.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefuly it is your 3rd aim, so we have time to discuss of this :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Leather and pole and straw
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Straw and wood
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Plank and paint
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Modern materials
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> future materials.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like this idea, but i am absolute zero with blender.
</I>&gt;<i> Linked to the tech level, it would be nice if low tech building only 
</I>&gt;<i> contains horses and cows, when high tech ones haves cars and trucks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe 5 categories is too much, but starting with 2 (pre or post 
</I>&gt;<i> industrial revolution) would already be great.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For 3 categories we have easy separations :
</I>&gt;<i> - old looking material
</I>&gt;<i>     - industrial revolution
</I>&gt;<i> - current tiles, no too techy not too old
</I>&gt;<i>     - space mastering
</I>&gt;<i> - future looking tiles
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am (slowly) gathering data about crop yield and thought of high tech 
</I>&gt;<i> farms (huge, maybe 8x8) with mechanicals, as opposed to normal &quot;bio&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> farms (current one 4x4 but with only bio material and no tractor, only 
</I>&gt;<i> horses or cows)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have other ideas (and datas) with respect to various important 
</I>&gt;<i> things (energy, pollution, price) and would like to set realistic 
</I>&gt;<i> orders of magnitude for the whole game, but this is a big task.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I could rebuild all image objects as such, and by age of their invention
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being their first. It would also add a touch of realism and perhaps even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> give the user a feeling of nostalgia and decision to keep or destroy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> old, beloved treasures of their Lin nation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I could preform the first plan without interfering with the second plan,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or force any more work, but objects would have to be a simple selection
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the second/third plan.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have been careful to make sure I will likely have the energy and will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to complete at least the first plan.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> wise :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for the monument, I will fix that as soon as I have perfected the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unified grass image, intending to blend and offer some warms,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> incorporating the light of the sun, with the green and occasional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yellows of the grass, but blend well. I will ensure it's blending from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tile to tile is good.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I will do my best to approach tasks consecutively, by importance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Enjoy is the most important, we will be happy to get your additional 
</I>&gt;<i> graphics
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alain.
