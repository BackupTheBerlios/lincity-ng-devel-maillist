Files seem to be in process or I have set it up wrong. I have set it up 
to GNU public licence.

Enclosed is concept.jpg.
This is an image dedicated to an idea I have about low-technology 
residential housing. Presently, it is straw roofs with plank walls.


I am entirely willing to completely spearhead the graphics effort, 
though there must be discussion on the topic.

As it was said, I am not skilled in programming, and any significant 
skill could take months, even with my fastest means of learning, 
tinkering with open source scripts.

In this sense, I not just want to help, but enjoy work in graphics.

There is the instances, but the later is alot of work. The first is a re 
skin of all objects to have a central theme, which would only imply a 
change of image objects. The second is tying a greater number of objects 
to the technology level, with progression. The third is, with a change 
of interface, many levels of housing, each with different population 
maximums, according to age...

Leather and pole and straw
Straw and wood
Plank and paint
Modern materials
future materials.


I could rebuild all image objects as such, and by age of their invention 
being their first. It would also add a touch of realism and perhaps even 
give the user a feeling of nostalgia and decision to keep or destroy 
old, beloved treasures of their Lin nation.


I could preform the first plan without interfering with the second plan, 
or force any more work, but objects would have to be a simple selection 
from the second/third plan.

I have been careful to make sure I will likely have the energy and will 
to complete at least the first plan.



As for the monument, I will fix that as soon as I have perfected the 
unified grass image, intending to blend and offer some warms, 
incorporating the light of the sun, with the green and occasional 
yellows of the grass, but blend well. I will ensure it's blending from 
tile to tile is good.


I will do my best to approach tasks consecutively, by importance.
