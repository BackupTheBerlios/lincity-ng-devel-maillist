<PRE>
Le 26/01/2011 00:33, Brandon Evans a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/projects/redsands/files/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/redsands/files/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Files seem to be in process or I have set it up wrong. I have set it up
</I>&gt;<i> to GNU public licence.
</I>
ok it contains currently 2 images of bridges with your fix to water color.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Enclosed is concept.jpg.
</I>&gt;<i> This is an image dedicated to an idea I have about low-technology
</I>&gt;<i> residential housing. Presently, it is straw roofs with plank walls.
</I>
I saw your other draft, and find it very nice.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am entirely willing to completely spearhead the graphics effort,
</I>&gt;<i> though there must be discussion on the topic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As it was said, I am not skilled in programming, and any significant
</I>&gt;<i> skill could take months, even with my fastest means of learning,
</I>&gt;<i> tinkering with open source scripts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this sense, I not just want to help, but enjoy work in graphics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is the instances, but the later is alot of work. The first is a re
</I>&gt;<i> skin of all objects to have a central theme, which would only imply a
</I>&gt;<i> change of image objects.
</I>Sounds great, but i have no idea of the amount of work to achieve this, 
probably a lot.

&gt;<i> The second is tying a greater number of objects
</I>&gt;<i> to the technology level, with progression.
</I>All buildings take into account the tech_level at build time (for 
production, pollution ...) but it is not visible in the graphic.
Having at least 2 kind of each building would make this much easier.
(and for each bulding there is animation linked to production...)

&gt;<i> The third is, with a change
</I>&gt;<i> of interface, many levels of housing, each with different population
</I>&gt;<i> maximums, according to age...
</I>Currently there are 6 type of houses (3 low tech and 3 high tech) and i 
find it complicate enough (maybe too much).  I dont think we need 
neither more houses nor more complicated rules to manage them.
Hopefuly it is your 3rd aim, so we have time to discuss of this :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Leather and pole and straw
</I>&gt;<i> Straw and wood
</I>&gt;<i> Plank and paint
</I>&gt;<i> Modern materials
</I>&gt;<i> future materials.
</I>
I like this idea, but i am absolute zero with blender.
Linked to the tech level, it would be nice if low tech building only 
contains horses and cows, when high tech ones haves cars and trucks.

Maybe 5 categories is too much, but starting with 2 (pre or post 
industrial revolution) would already be great.

For 3 categories we have easy separations :
- old looking material
	- industrial revolution
- current tiles, no too techy not too old
	- space mastering
- future looking tiles


I am (slowly) gathering data about crop yield and thought of high tech 
farms (huge, maybe 8x8) with mechanicals, as opposed to normal &quot;bio&quot; 
farms (current one 4x4 but with only bio material and no tractor, only 
horses or cows)

I have other ideas (and datas) with respect to various important things 
(energy, pollution, price) and would like to set realistic orders of 
magnitude for the whole game, but this is a big task.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I could rebuild all image objects as such, and by age of their invention
</I>&gt;<i> being their first. It would also add a touch of realism and perhaps even
</I>&gt;<i> give the user a feeling of nostalgia and decision to keep or destroy
</I>&gt;<i> old, beloved treasures of their Lin nation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I could preform the first plan without interfering with the second plan,
</I>&gt;<i> or force any more work, but objects would have to be a simple selection
</I>&gt;<i> from the second/third plan.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been careful to make sure I will likely have the energy and will
</I>&gt;<i> to complete at least the first plan.
</I>
wise :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the monument, I will fix that as soon as I have perfected the
</I>&gt;<i> unified grass image, intending to blend and offer some warms,
</I>&gt;<i> incorporating the light of the sun, with the green and occasional
</I>&gt;<i> yellows of the grass, but blend well. I will ensure it's blending from
</I>&gt;<i> tile to tile is good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will do my best to approach tasks consecutively, by importance.
</I>
Enjoy is the most important, we will be happy to get your additional 
graphics

Alain.
