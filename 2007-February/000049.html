<PRE>Hi everybody

I believe that the only (serious :) lack to lincity(-ng) is water management.
I expanded significantly the section
<A HREF="http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Wish_list#Water.">http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Wish_list#Water.</A>

I m thinking about implementing it:
#  Water availability can be computed from the initial map, from shortest
 distance to navigable water. Areas without water should be yellow-brown
 like desert.
# new building = well/water station (with a range), who feed all human
 activities, so everything except mines, tips, windmills, solar plants,
 power lines, transports, monuments (they nearly all exist in Sahara)
 =&gt; need to adapt mini map and informations

Later should come the most interesting part: pollution 
# water quality (like pollution):
 very good = cristal clear, good = drinkable, not bad = agriculture quality, 
 bad = industrial quality, mortal.
# contamination of water by pollution (industries, tips, high tech farms)
 and propagation of pollution along the water path.
# contamination of air due to polluted waters.
# depollution with parks along the path or around the well.

Refinement:
# Areas without water could need high-tech deep well and/or pipes to feed
 the water station.

One big issue would be the incompatibility with previous versions. This would
need either a &quot;compatibilty-mode&quot; (no water) or add some kind of
subsidy to enable one player to add water capacities to his city.

I just gave a quick look at the engine, so i don't realize how difficult
it can be, and i m new to C++ (i know a little C, but mainly i was
fortran developper in fluid dynamics). I think it would take some monthes
before this work smoothly.

Well, i hope to have lots of comments/criticism about this :)
Cheers
Alain
