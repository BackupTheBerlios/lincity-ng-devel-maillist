<PRE>Hi Avery


Le 17/09/2010 &#224; 01:28, Avery White a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Salutations,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After spending quite a bit of time on this, I've decided to create a sort of
</I>&gt;<i> 'handbook' for new developers (and to serve as a reference when I'm looking
</I>&gt;<i> for a function that I saw an hour ago...but now can't remember where it is
</I>&gt;<i> for the life of me). The bottom line is that LinCity-NG needs documentation
</I>&gt;<i> for the developer, heck, *I* need this because to me, this is incredibly
</I>&gt;<i> confusing.
</I>
There is a kind of documentation in the wiki
<A HREF="http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Developer#Eternal_Development">http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Developer#Eternal_Development</A>

For me the UI is confusing, but the engine is clear
I welcome any doc you can write about the UI, but take care of not
losing your aim.

Maybe adding your notes/remarks/comments in the wiki (and the code?) is
enought and it would take much less time than a formalised book.

&gt;<i> Since doing a re-write is beyond the scope of what I can do on my
</I>&gt;<i> lonesome (or beyond what I think the dev team leaders would like a focus
</I>&gt;<i> on), this is something that I can do. I will kindly submit what I finish to
</I>&gt;<i> you guys for refinement (GPL of course!).
</I>
I think you should write this in a place where we can read it and if
possible write too. We globally know how it works, so we can
answer your questions, or at least give some hints.

&gt;<i> I get an understandable field
</I>&gt;<i> manual that my supervisors would very much like to have so they know I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> wasting their time (as well as something I can use to keep everything
</I>&gt;<i> straight), and you guys get the same - and something to feed new developers
</I>&gt;<i> so they can get up to speed quickly so as to start writing relevant code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The goal:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) To enable new developers so that they may contribute to the subsequent
</I>&gt;<i> versions of LinCity-NG without wasting time simply 'figuring out' the code.
</I>
I think you should not spend too much time on this large task.

&gt;<i> 2) To provide a ready quick-reference to existing developers
</I>
Yes small quick ref guide is good (and fast to write)


&gt;<i> 3) To prevent redundantly answering questions posed to the uninitiated
</I>
The traffic on the list is very low, we can answer all the questions.

&gt;<i> 4) *To speed up the overall development of LinCity-NG*
</I>
The developpement is done by volunteers (like you and me), and currently
there are no big development going on, so nothing to speed-up.
I hope that your project and enthousiasm will make things move faster :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A few notes concerning the specification:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) It will be written under the GPL
</I>&gt;<i> 2) It will be written as an .odt text document (i.e. but not limited to,
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOffice)
</I>&gt;<i> 3) It's design is to *introduce *the source code of LinCity
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some preferences that I would kindly ask if this idea 'takes':
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) People typically don't read manuals over 75 pages if they can help it. My
</I>&gt;<i> goal is to keep this document near that (hence *introduction). *
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Information that exceeds that should (in my opinion) go to another,
</I>&gt;<i> albeit similar, document entirely: LinCity Handbook 2 (for example).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While writing this so far...I do have a question: How many countries are
</I>&gt;<i> currently represented by the dev team?
</I>
In data/locale there are 15 differents languages (plus english)
 
&gt;<i> Kind Regards (and I will be eagerly awaiting your reply!),
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> _______________________________________________

Kind regards
