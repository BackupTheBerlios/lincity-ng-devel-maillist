<PRE>Salutations,

After spending quite a bit of time on this, I've decided to create a sort of
'handbook' for new developers (and to serve as a reference when I'm looking
for a function that I saw an hour ago...but now can't remember where it is
for the life of me). The bottom line is that LinCity-NG needs documentation
for the developer, heck, *I* need this because to me, this is incredibly
confusing. Since doing a re-write is beyond the scope of what I can do on my
lonesome (or beyond what I think the dev team leaders would like a focus
on), this is something that I can do. I will kindly submit what I finish to
you guys for refinement (GPL of course!). I get an understandable field
manual that my supervisors would very much like to have so they know I'm not
wasting their time (as well as something I can use to keep everything
straight), and you guys get the same - and something to feed new developers
so they can get up to speed quickly so as to start writing relevant code.

The goal:

1) To enable new developers so that they may contribute to the subsequent
versions of LinCity-NG without wasting time simply 'figuring out' the code.
2) To provide a ready quick-reference to existing developers
3) To prevent redundantly answering questions posed to the uninitiated
4) *To speed up the overall development of LinCity-NG*

A few notes concerning the specification:

1) It will be written under the GPL
2) It will be written as an .odt text document (i.e. but not limited to,
OpenOffice)
3) It's design is to *introduce *the source code of LinCity

Some preferences that I would kindly ask if this idea 'takes':

1) People typically don't read manuals over 75 pages if they can help it. My
goal is to keep this document near that (hence *introduction). *
2) Information that exceeds that should (in my opinion) go to another,
albeit similar, document entirely: LinCity Handbook 2 (for example).

While writing this so far...I do have a question: How many countries are
currently represented by the dev team?

Kind Regards (and I will be eagerly awaiting your reply!),
