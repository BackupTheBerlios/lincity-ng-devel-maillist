<PRE>Le 08/09/2010 &#224; 18:22, Avery White a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Alain,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it me, or could LinCity stand to be re-written? 
</I>I feel so too, but it is a quite big job.

&gt;<i> I just feel like it's so spread out, back-dependent (on the older version),
</I>
while fixing several bugs and adding (kind of) water management i did my best
to clarify/simplify the engine code while keeping compatibility with previous
versions, and made efforts to better separate UI from engine 
(with the secret desire to throw away this GUI)

&gt;<i> choppy gui (that I've found to be *difficult* to work with)
</I>I am pleased not to be the only one lost in this complex GUI. :-)
and not only it is hard to use/modify/understand, but it is also horribly slow

&gt;<i>...thoughts?
</I>Yes many : 
1/ it *must* be discussed in the mailing list, (so i post on the list too)
as there are some other guys around here that may have good ideas, could
 help a lot (and already did several patches or have write access to svn)

2/ I would like to throw the GUI and get a simple one
	- either use some existing thing 
	- or make a simple one IMGUI ( = ala old fashion, direct code,
		 no fancy but inefficient code ;-) )
		
I started src/TinyLandGen with this in mind, just to learn SDL from scratch,
and found it very easy.

3/ I draw an interface i would like to get, and put some picture in a ticket

4/ On the engine side maybe touch nothing currently, (as it works and is 
debugged), but i feel it could be much easier to add new features
if we have a good data structure, and objects for buildings/events.
This need to be well discussed and analysed.

I don't have too much time currently, but i hope things will stabilize soon.
Kind regards
Alain
