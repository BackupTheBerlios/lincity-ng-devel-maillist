<PRE>Alain,

Wow!! I had no idea that all of this was there - this is great!

I was able to edit the appropriate .xml file such that a checkbox appears as
a part of the 'market' list (i.e tradedialog.xml). So, with this knowledge
in hand, I'm attempting to make the necessary changes to create a checkbox
dialog pop up for Low Impact Developments (LID) that appears when a
residential structure is clicked and causes some affect in the simulation.
I'm having some trouble with this...

1) Getting the code into the .xml file is relatively straightforward, but
figuring out how the dialog pops up on click is proving to be a bit more
difficult.

2) Modifying the code such that the checkbox affects gameplay is also
proving to be difficult.

3) I think both 1 and 2 stem from the fact that I do not understand how
global variables work in LinCity. Essentially, I need only to keep a boolean
value for each structure:

Is this in lincity/modules/ ? I mean, will I simply need to add this
variable to the residential classes? This would make sense to me...then
write a function that accesses this variable? (I would do this such that
each instantiation of a residence can remember whether or not it has an
LID).

This is the direction I will be taking (in addition to the newfound
reading!) - more hints are always welcome!

Kind Regards,

Avery

&gt;<i> Hi Avery

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Le 17/09/2010 &#224; 01:28, Avery White a &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Salutations,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After spending quite a bit of time on this, I've decided to create a sort
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'handbook' for new developers (and to serve as a reference when I'm
</I>&gt;<i> looking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for a function that I saw an hour ago...but now can't remember where it
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the life of me). The bottom line is that LinCity-NG needs
</I>&gt;<i> documentation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the developer, heck, *I* need this because to me, this is incredibly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; confusing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a kind of documentation in the wiki
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Developer#Eternal_Development">http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Developer#Eternal_Development</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For me the UI is confusing, but the engine is clear
</I>&gt;<i> I welcome any doc you can write about the UI, but take care of not
</I>&gt;<i> losing your aim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe adding your notes/remarks/comments in the wiki (and the code?) is
</I>&gt;<i> enought and it would take much less time than a formalised book.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since doing a re-write is beyond the scope of what I can do on my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lonesome (or beyond what I think the dev team leaders would like a focus
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on), this is something that I can do. I will kindly submit what I finish
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you guys for refinement (GPL of course!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you should write this in a place where we can read it and if
</I>&gt;<i> possible write too. We globally know how it works, so we can
</I>&gt;<i> answer your questions, or at least give some hints.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I get an understandable field
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manual that my supervisors would very much like to have so they know I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wasting their time (as well as something I can use to keep everything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; straight), and you guys get the same - and something to feed new
</I>&gt;<i> developers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so they can get up to speed quickly so as to start writing relevant code.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The goal:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) To enable new developers so that they may contribute to the subsequent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; versions of LinCity-NG without wasting time simply 'figuring out' the
</I>&gt;<i> code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you should not spend too much time on this large task.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) To provide a ready quick-reference to existing developers
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes small quick ref guide is good (and fast to write)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) To prevent redundantly answering questions posed to the uninitiated
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The traffic on the list is very low, we can answer all the questions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) *To speed up the overall development of LinCity-NG*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The developpement is done by volunteers (like you and me), and currently
</I>&gt;<i> there are no big development going on, so nothing to speed-up.
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that your project and enthousiasm will make things move faster :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A few notes concerning the specification:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) It will be written under the GPL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) It will be written as an .odt text document (i.e. but not limited to,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OpenOffice)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) It's design is to *introduce *the source code of LinCity
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some preferences that I would kindly ask if this idea 'takes':
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) People typically don't read manuals over 75 pages if they can help it.
</I>&gt;<i> My
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; goal is to keep this document near that (hence *introduction). *
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) Information that exceeds that should (in my opinion) go to another,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; albeit similar, document entirely: LinCity Handbook 2 (for example).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While writing this so far...I do have a question: How many countries are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; currently represented by the dev team?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In data/locale there are 15 differents languages (plus english)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Kind Regards (and I will be eagerly awaiting your reply!),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
