</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; choppy gui (that I've found to be *difficult* to work with)
</I>&gt;<i> I am pleased not to be the only one lost in this complex GUI. :-)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;...thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes many : 
</I>&gt;<i> 1/ it *must* be discussed in the mailing list, (so i post on the list too)

</I>&gt;<i> I started src/TinyLandGen with this in mind, just to learn SDL from scratch,

As the one who has written the gui Code back in the time, I wonder why
you think the GUI is inefficient. I doubt it's the GUI that slows
lincity down but simply because its high-resolution graphics in possibly
big screen resolutions.

Also from what I remember nothing stops you from creating GUIs in code
right now except that it is alot more stuff to write.

I never thought the GUI to be complex. But then again without any real
documentation it might be really confusing to start out on it. I was
kinda proud about the GUI back then and thought it was a part that
worked out nicely in lincity-ng...

Anyway I'm just lurking on this mailing list, I don't have time for
lincity (or any open-source projects) anymore. So don't let yourself be
stopped in any way. The ones doing the work should decide where
open-source projects go :)

Greetings,
	Matze
