I am sorry if i offended you, it was not my aim :-)
Maybe i am wrong by saying it is the GUI, but there is something in
the graphic handling that make -NG much slower than classic on a given hardware.

&gt;<i> I doubt it's the GUI that slows
</I>&gt;<i> lincity down but simply because its high-resolution graphics in possibly
</I>&gt;<i> big screen resolutions.
</I>
Yes it is part of the problem.

The font management is rather slow (click on stats... and wait for the
window to popup), 

The findComponent seems really weird to me (recurses up to 600 times for
analysing xml files with 10 sections)

xml gui files (ala xhtml) *were* automatically generated from a really
simple file (lets says 2 fields), then parsed to retrieve the simple
information and display it (the said 2 fields).
I guess it can be done in a much shorter path ; display the 2 fields directly
without xml generation and parsing.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also from what I remember nothing stops you from creating GUIs in code
</I>&gt;<i> right now except that it is alot more stuff to write.
</I>
True, it is really a big job, thats why so far i did not even spoke of changing
it (until Avery's mail due to his very interesting project)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I never thought the GUI to be complex. But then again without any real
</I>&gt;<i> documentation it might be really confusing to start out on it. I was
</I>&gt;<i> kinda proud about the GUI back then and thought it was a part that
</I>&gt;<i> worked out nicely in lincity-ng...
</I>
Yes it works, it is nice.
I never learn object programming, maybe that's why i find it difficult to
understand.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway I'm just lurking on this mailing list, I don't have time for
</I>&gt;<i> lincity (or any open-source projects) anymore. So don't let yourself be
</I>&gt;<i> stopped in any way. The ones doing the work should decide where
</I>&gt;<i> open-source projects go :)
</I>
Thanks, i consider this as a nice encouragement (and you really know how
big is the task we are speaking of). We will try to do better, after
having learnt from your job :) .

Greetings
Alain
