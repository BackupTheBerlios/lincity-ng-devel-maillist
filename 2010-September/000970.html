<PRE>Le 02/09/2010 &#224; 00:03, Avery White a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Alain,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Hi again Avery
(i reply on the list...)

&gt;<i> I think I figure out most of the things I had mentioned in my previous
</I>&gt;<i> email. As I had said before, I'm trying to take out the fire functionality.
</I>&gt;<i> On the simulation side, I think I have everything done. However, on the
</I>&gt;<i> graphics side...it's proving to be more challenging. What is the user-menu
</I>&gt;<i> on the left side of the screen called? I'm trying to remove the firestation
</I>&gt;<i> entity (Monument, health, sports field, etc).
</I>
The UI is described in xml files located in /data/gui

the main toolbar is in /data/gui/buttonpanel.xml
and related actions are in /src/lincity-ng/ButtonPanel.cpp

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To do this, I've commented out the firestation group in &quot;lintypes.cpp&quot; 
</I>
&gt;<i> (and
</I>&gt;<i> the GROUP_FIRESTATION variable in a variety of other places)...but this only
</I>&gt;<i> moves the descriptions around (i.e. now the &quot;firestation&quot; is gone, but
</I>&gt;<i> places a monument instead...like the array just went back to the first
</I>&gt;<i> element (which is monument in that menu), consequently, &quot;Sports Field&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> now &quot;Shanty Town&quot;...which is the next group listed in lintypes.cpp, near
</I>&gt;<i> line 400). So the behavior I'm getting is pseudo-predictable. 
</I>
oh oh !
As you saw you should not modify lintypes.cpp, because it a declaration
with initialisation :
  struct GROUP main_groups[NUM_OF_GROUPS] = {
  ...
  }
If you comment out some part, the count will change, so you'll need to 
change all the numbers in groups.h and modify all saved files accordingly!

You should just leave it untouched, or add your new builings at the end of
the list (and in groups.h ...)

&gt;<i> I just wish I
</I>&gt;<i> could eliminate the graphic entirely. Any thoughts would be appreciated.
</I>
I am not sure i understand what you want:
- use a saved game and replace all existing firestations by (let's say) trees
or 
- de-activate firestations (and supress them from tools) but keep their graphics
if some exists (as they are nice buildings :-) )
