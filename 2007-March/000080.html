<PRE>Hi 

I noticed that it is possible to have total jobs in market 
greater than the total population, and this does not include the 
number of jobs on transport or stored in buildings. Also the &quot;jobs&quot;
can drop to nearly zero and the economy still work fine.
This is very counter intuitive :-)

Unless i miss something in the source (hmm this is possible ;-),
this is due to a feature of the engine: jobs are treated like other
goods, so they can be stored in markets/transports/factories, which is
really practical and simple, and is _needed_ for transport.

Obviously, people are not ordinary goods that can be stored in
market/transport for later use :)
To fix this without completely breaking the engine, especially job 
propagation through transports, i'm wondering about the following :
total_jobs = sum of successful get_jobs 
	(this is still slightly approximated because building
	can get jobs and not use them imediatly due to a shortage
	of another resource, but this will not last very long, the
	job_stock will soon be full. This is easy to implement
	it needs only a change in get_jobs, whereas exact computation
	demand modification of all the modules, so for a first try
	this should be enough)

unemployment = jobs successfully provided by residences - total_jobs 
	+ number of failure to provide jobs due to market full of job (this
				is current unemployment)

additional unemployment cost begin if unemployment &gt; few % to keep the 
behavior similar to current engine.
 
Due to the job &quot;stocks&quot; unemployment could be negative, which means the
demand for jobs is greater than the number of available jobs, so sooner
or later some factories will not be supplied with jobs.
This would need a change in ECO minigraph to draw negative values,
and also in unemployment minimap : negative unemployment could be shown
let's say in yellow (negative but currently supplied) and white (unsupplied).

This could give a nice minimap:
if on one side we have all houses and far away all industries, with very poor
transport between, there would be unemployment (red) in houses, and (yellow
and white) in factories.

Any comment will be considered :)
Cheers
Alain
