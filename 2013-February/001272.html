<PRE>2013/2/25 Heikki Ketoharju &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/lincity-ng-devel">heikki.ketoharju at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Maybe most disturbing thing are those cars in parking lot of the
</I>&gt;<i> market. When game has started and schools haven't invented yet, there
</I>&gt;<i> are still cars parked in front of the market... Maybe market sprite
</I>&gt;<i> could be changed so that the building itself would be same, but
</I>&gt;<i> vehicles around it would change: for example from wagons to cars?
</I>
I don't think a supermarket is the right image for this building. It
serves more as a warehouse or storage building, since it transfers
coal and steel at an industrial scale. Not really the stuff you would
buy in your local supermarket :) I am working on better images for
this building.

I still think this building should have two different images for the
different eras: an old fashioned street market and a modern warehouse
building. Their function and capacity can be the same, only the looks
would be different. And looks are actually pretty important in a city
building game.

Best regards,
Ivar ten Cate
