&gt;<i> I don't think a supermarket is the right image for this building. It

You are probably right. Markets in Lincity seem to serve several
different purposes: they are like warehouses since they transfer coal
and steel, but they also serve food for local citizens and transfer
labour to different industries. I don't think warehouses transfer jobs
to industries or food to consumers? Maybe we shouldn't search too
literal metaphor for this: are there any places in real world, that
transfer all that?

Warehouse could still be good for this, because there should of course
be something showing the place of market... I think market should have
differing colors so that it would be easy to locate: at least for me
markets and roads are most important objects in game, because they
really drive everything.
