<PRE>Two or three different markets would mean a change in game mechanics
also, and I'm not sure if that's a good idea. At least I haven't had
any problems with current markets. I think it's very important that in
some point markets start filling up and slowing down the flow of
stuff. It makes the game more challenging. With bigger markets that
kind of problem would probably be absent and playing would become more
boring.

Maybe most disturbing thing are those cars in parking lot of the
market. When game has started and schools haven't invented yet, there
are still cars parked in front of the market... Maybe market sprite
could be changed so that the building itself would be same, but
vechiles around it would change: for example from wagons to cars?
