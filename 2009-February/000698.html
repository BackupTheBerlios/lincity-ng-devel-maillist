When I started with lincity one year ago I did something very similar. It just didn't have the config setting. I never published a patch, because I wanted to wait till 2.0 was released. I'll attach the patch to this mail. Maybe you can use something of it. To some buildings I also added more information. E.g. Jobs and Tech-level to the light industry. The changes to stats.cpp and pbar.cpp change the display of the stats tap, so that it shows the real values. Originally the numbers were divided by some arbitrary values. The changes in stats.cpp and pbar.cpp are independent of the others and could be applied to svn separately.

</I>
Maybe this is also to prevent that a building which needs a lot of jobs can starve the other buildings of jobs.

&gt;<i> * I plan on changing the text &quot;Jobs&quot; for mps_market to &quot;Workers&quot; to properly

</I>
I'm not sure if &quot;Workers&quot; is the best word for it. It may be better than &quot;Jobs&quot; though. But when I read workers in the market, I somehow imagine that the people are taken out of their houses and stuffed in a supermarket. The concept here seems more like &quot;saved man-days&quot;. But man-days does not sound so good. Maybe we could name it &quot;Work&quot; or &quot;Labour&quot;. What do the others think ?
