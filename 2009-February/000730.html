<PRE>Hi,

I forward this message to the Lincity mailing list, because Daniel
only sent it to me. My actual reply will be in my next post to this
list.

</I>Agreed.  I think it's to Lincity's credit that it's not a sim city clone :)

&gt;<i> Maybe we can add a line to the start menu which says that this game

</I>Doesn't sound like a bad idea to me


&gt;<i> &gt; - people want to control money (give less than 100% funding for
</I>&gt;<i> social....)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  instead of having to build/destroy buildings.
</I>&gt;<i> That's a good idea in my opinion. A lower fund would result in a
</I>&gt;<i> smaller coverage of a social building (e.g. fire stations).
</I>I'm in support of this too, adding that massively underfunded buildings
should incur some type of deterioration that will require repairs if they
actually want to get it working decently again -- thus, if they want to pull
a Bush and later on decided it was a bad idea, there should be additional
costs to repair the damaged infrastructure before being able to get it
working at the desired capacity again.

To clarify with an example implementation, if they reduce social spending
below some threshold, of say 40%, then there is a random chance each month
that deterioration begins (0% chance at 40%, 50% chance at 20%, 100% chance
at 0%, or &quot;float chance = social_spending &lt; 0.40f ? 0.40f - social_spending :
0.f&quot; -- or it can be a logarithm).  So once deterioration begins, the
infrastructure has a random chance of deteriorating each month to a minimum
capacity of the amount they reduced social spending to.  Again, the chance
that it will deteriorate each month should be based upon how underfunded they
are.  Thus, to increase it beyond point that deterioration has reached, they
would have to pay the adjusted cost of the buildings again, or destroy and
completely rebuild them (in case they want to move them anyway).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - They find difficult to understand why a building does not work. They
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  would like clear messages explaining everything.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Hmm, i m not sure i like to explain everything. Part of the fun is to
</I>&gt;<i> think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  to understand what happens, but maybe i'm biased due to knowledge of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  engine ?
</I>&gt;<i> I think we have to reckon with new players, who don't immediately

</I>
Ohh! This could go in the mps code that I've been working on anyway.  Want to
hear something funny?  Jaky sent me a patch that he had intended upon putting
the mps code and it turned out to be almost *exactly* what I wrote!! Great
minds think alike eh!? :D

So, question:  If you guys decide that you want a building to be able to tell
a user why it isn't working:
1. When should it generate a message?  Any time it's below 80% capacity?  Or
should it only offer the information if it's been low for a while.  While C
code into the MpsInterface doesn't or isn't set up to exploit it, I believe
that the actual panel getting written to is some fancy type of HTML-ish
enabled component, so we should be able to make bad things appear in red text
or something (I need to do my homework and examine that code).  So I'm not
sure, please advise how you think this should work and maybe I can do it
while I'm touching that area of the code anyway (and I agree, have a config
option in userdata.xml to disable it).
