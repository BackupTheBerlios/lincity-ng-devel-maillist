<PRE>
I started playing lincity-ng a few weeks ago and have had a good deal of fun
with it, despite the fact that I have yet to win a game (I'm still learning
:<i>).  None the less, I wanted to measure the dev team's interest in patch
</I>submissions.  I've been tinkering with the code and learning it's
architecture -- very interesting.  It's nice to be reminded of the early days
in development when resources were so much more scarce by working with the C
portions of the code.  It's been a little while since doing pure C, so it's a
nice refresher.

So anyway, I've done a little development to:
* Add a config option for statistical display mode with the settings
&quot;percentage&quot;, &quot;values&quot; and &quot;both&quot; and added a new function void
mps_store_sddp(int i, const char * s, int cur, int max) to
src/gui_interface/mps.h and src/lincity-ng/MpsInterface.cpp to use in place
of mps_store_sfp.  This function, based upon the config setting displays
either a precentage (as mps_store_sfp currently does), values in the form of
&quot;cur/max&quot; or both in the form of &quot;cur/max (p%)&quot;.
* Added void num_to_ansi2(char *s, size_t size, long num, size_t digits, bool
strip_trailing); to src/lincity/lclib.h &amp; cpp which performs the same as
num_to_ansi except that it allows you to explicitly specify the number of
significant digits (both before and after decimal place, so numbers with a
greater power of 10 have less digits after the decimal place) as well as
optionally strip trialling zeros after the decimal, as well as the decimal
place its self if not needed (thus, 56000 will be displayed as &quot;56k&quot; and not
&quot;56.0k&quot;).  I like this as the interface feels a little cleaner.  The new
mps_store_sddp function uses this to render numbers to text.
* Modified src/lincity/modules/*.cpp mps_* functions to utilize
mps_store_sddp where it makes sense to do so.

I've also made a few changes so far that actually alter game-play.
* Added a new mechanism for calculating tech bonuses, that leaves the numbers
coded as constants in lin-city.h.  Values are:
  o &lt;building&gt;_TECH_BONUS_PROD
  o &lt;building&gt;_TECH_BONUS_STORAGE
  o &lt;building&gt;_TECH_BONUS_AQUISITION
  o &lt;building&gt;_TECH_BONUS_CONSUMPTION
* Modified pottery, blacksmith, mill and mill to utilize these values for a
tech bonus (in the process of changing farm too, but there is a lot to
consider in this one).  The x_PROD bonus is a multiplier attached to the tech
level to determine how much production is changed by the tech level,
x_STORAGE alters how many units of supplies and producibles are stored,
x_ACQUISITION alters how quickly resources and jobs are acquired while
x_CONSUMPTION alters the rate of consumption.  Any of these may actually be
negative, as would make sense in some cases, for example, applied to
consumption to reflect increased efficiency.  Having these values defined
generically in lin-city.h makes it easier to view them at a glance and tweak
as needed without modifying the actual module's code.
* Adding a get_jobs2 function to src/lincity/modules/market.h/cpp to
eventually replace get_jobs.  This function will return the number of jobs
acquired and will acquisition less jobs than requested.  Then I plan to
modify all calls to get_jobs to accept what jobs it can get and attempt
production with a minimal work force rather than completely abort.  There are
however a lot of nuances I don't quite understand yet, like the fact that the
current get_jobs will not return true unless the 150% of the requested jobs
are actually available.
* I plan on changing the text &quot;Jobs&quot; for mps_market to &quot;Workers&quot; to properly
reflect that this is a surplus of workers available.
* Finally, I don't yet understand the locale framework and what needs to be
done to realign all the .pot translation files, as I've noticed that they
explicitly specify the source file names &amp; line numbers where each string  is
substituted.

So I'm mostly playing around at this point and learning the app &amp; concepts
behind the game design, but if any of what I'm doing can be of interest to
you guys, I would be more than happy to contribute some.  This is the 1st sim
game I've worked on and I'm rather enjoying learning from it. :)
