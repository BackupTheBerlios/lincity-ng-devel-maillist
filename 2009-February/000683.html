ooh!  Thanks for the response! :)

I've been very careful to keep the pure-C code pure C, while using features
that modern compilers do well with that older ones didn't, like inlined
functions and static const global variables vs #defines for common functions
&amp; global constants.  I have a slightly improved get_stuff function now that
actually shrinks code slightly and adds a very minimal number of extra
instructions per execution.  The original coders were definitely some very
clever guys!

&gt;<i> &gt; I've also made a few changes so far that actually alter game-play.
</I>&gt;<i> Its frightening to change the engine, because it has lots of interactions,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> is globally non-linear (even if each module is quasi linear)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What is the aim ?
</I>&gt;<i> How big is the impact ?
</I>&gt;<i> Sustanability should be kept (or nealry kept) and also it must be possible
</I>&gt;<i> to win with rocket evacuation.
</I>
I agree with you on alterations to game play, 1000%.  The modifications are
to basically allow tech bonuses on more buildings.  As an example, it doesn't
matter at which tech level you build a mill, it will always perform the same.
 The numbers will all appear in lin-city.h so as to be easily tweakable. 
These are the current values I'm using as example (removing the &quot;static const
float&quot; from each so it wont word wrap):

POTTERY_TECH_BONUS_PROD          = 0.25f;
POTTERY_TECH_BONUS_STORAGE       = POTTERY_TECH_BONUS_PROD / 2.f;
POTTERY_TECH_BONUS_ACQUISITION   = POTTERY_TECH_BONUS_PROD / 2.f;
POTTERY_TECH_BONUS_CONSUMPTION   = POTTERY_TECH_BONUS_PROD / 2.f;

BLACKSMITH_TECH_BONUS_PROD       = 0.375f;
BLACKSMITH_TECH_BONUS_STORAGE    = BLACKSMITH_TECH_BONUS_PROD / 3.f;
BLACKSMITH_TECH_BONUS_ACQUISITION= BLACKSMITH_TECH_BONUS_PROD / 2.5f;
BLACKSMITH_TECH_BONUS_CONSUMPTION= BLACKSMITH_TECH_BONUS_PROD / 2.5f;

MILL_TECH_BONUS_PROD             = 0.50f;
MILL_TECH_BONUS_STORAGE          = MILL_TECH_BONUS_PROD / 4.f;
MILL_TECH_BONUS_ACQUISITION      = MILL_TECH_BONUS_PROD / 3.f;
MILL_TECH_BONUS_CONSUMPTION      = MILL_TECH_BONUS_PROD / 3.f;

These are intended to be more generic variables for the do_&lt;building&gt;()
functions and represent the bonus to be applied at 100 tech beyond the
minimal build tech level (in other words, multiplied by (float)(MP_TECH(x, y)
- GROUP_&lt;building&gt;_TECH) / MAX_TECH_LEVEL).

In summary, the &quot;prod&quot; the bonus to production (of whatever is made),
&quot;storage&quot; to what it can store, &quot;acquisition&quot; to the amount when it calls
get_stuff/get_jobs and &quot;consumption&quot; to what is used (jobs, coal, etc.). I
don't necessarily believe these are appropriate values, it's just a starting
point.  The main issue that I have is that many buildings continue to cost
more to build as time goes by, but yield no extra benefit and should
legitimately become more efficient as technology increases. So the aim is to
more accurately reflect real world economies and the progression of
manufacturing as it pertains to technological advances.  My initial numbers
basically say that pottery doesn't have as much room for streamlining, but
blacksmithing has more and mills have even more.  Compare this with farms
who's _TECH_BONUS_PROD value is 1.0f (or +100% bonus at tech level 100). The
impact would be an increase in output per map cells and resources used, so
naturally it may need to be offset elsewhere for game balance.  The example
&quot;bonuses&quot; to consumption above actually increase consumption, it just
increases it more slowly than production, yielding an overall improvement to
efficiency.

&gt;<i> My understanding is: you need a large pool of workers in order to find the
</I>&gt;<i> people you need. This is done by the 150% (which is a very kind coeff) 
</I>cool, thanks!  I had actually considered this, that there would be louts
littering the job market that just aren't suitable for much, as well as the
simple fact of some people not wanting particular types of work and being
willing to wait for a better job.  I've already completed this functionality
for getting jobs from both the market and transport (I have a new get_stuff
function), so I'll figure out how to re-introduce this 150% functionality
(basically, that only 2/3rds of a worker population are suitable).

&gt;<i> The strings are grabbed at compilation time (maybe if you activate one
</I>&gt;<i> option, 
</I>&gt;<i> i dont remember) and the english reference file is updated automatically.
</I>&gt;<i> The script in src/tools/update_po.sh is used to sync everything with
</I>&gt;<i> english.
</I>&gt;<i> The .pot file are build by tool which add the numbering in comments, and
</I>&gt;<i> can be edited with poedit (or whatever you like) to do the needed
</I>&gt;<i> translations.
</I>Ahh, wonderful!  I did notice seeing something at the end of the build each
time related to the .pot files.  Luckily, I'm familiar with the basics of the
jam-based build system because I've worked on Glest, which matze also happen
work on, and used his jam-based build system on.

So I'm subscribed to the list and when I get things ironed out a bit I'll
post a patch (or probably try to separate the functionality into separate
patches).

Finally, I added a mechanism to calculate and display a monthly running
average of output for each building (only implemented for pottery, blacksmith
and mill thus far).  Every day, when do_&lt;building&gt;() is called, it calls a
function I added to stats.h/cpp that adds that day's production value into a
stack that holds NUMOF_DAYS_IN_MONTH values, drops the old value and provides
a mechanism to quickly retrieve the average. It's not a terribly important
feature imo, but I rather like it.  The down side is that I either need to
add a mechanism to load_game to re-init empty buffers or bump the saved game
version and add it to save_game and load_game (i.e., have it save the month
of history).  I'll probably do one of the two and then actually play a game
for a little while. :)

Thanks for the help!
Daniel
