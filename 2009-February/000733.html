Thanks for the responses.

&gt;<i> Agreed, maybe we can even have special graphics for underfunded
</I>&gt;<i> buildings. We can use the same system for tracks, roads and rails. So
</I>&gt;<i> underfunded roads have less capacity. Visually holes can be visible in
</I>&gt;<i> the road/track surface.
</I>Can you do an Idiocracy style hospital?

Ok, just a joke :)  But seriously, it sounds like a good idea.

&gt;<i> I think the text should appear in a bar at the bottom of the screen.
</I>&gt;<i> Different colors for different possibilities is a good idea.
</I>I was thinking of just having it in the information tab when you click on it,
but a message that appears when you aren't looking at it sounds better.

Not to try to &quot;imitate&quot; simcity, but I do like the idea of a scrolling
marquee or something similar.  But I also like the idea of random events that
effect game play (I'm mostly thinking of Monopoly's Community Chest and the
events from an old Commodore 64 game called Mule).  If such a thing were
implemented, I think it should be optional and you could determine the
frequency in the config.  In general, it should be a mixture of positive and
negative events and there has to be a big variety to keep it from getting
repetitive (so that part requires a lot of creativity).  But it could get
tricky because the results could potentially interfere with stability.
