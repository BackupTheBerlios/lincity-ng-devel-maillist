<PRE>Hi

I posted the news of Linicty-ng 2 in a french floss forum, and got some
interesting comments. 
It seems that previous players (olde guys, more thn 30 yo ;-) find it very
nice with great graphics and enjoy the intersting gameplay, whereas new
players (younger, used to fancy 3d gamestations?) find it not so good and
quickly stop playing without trying harder.

I sumarize the main points, and give my point of vue:

- compared to simcity 2000 with graphics ala 3000. 
 newcomers expect lincity to behave like simcity N.
 my guess = and so they are disapointed.
 We should be more different, and advertise it from the start of the game. 

- sustanable development is a nice original feature :-)

- numbers given for roads are confusing (sum greater than 100%).
 &quot;The are great for developpers, but useless for players.&quot;

 Also they expect to have flux indication (100% = trafficjam), whereas
 we display available quantity.
 Also , due to the engine (propagation by diffusion) dead-end roads are
 full of workers and good. This confuses people.

- lack of a reference manual: the building's help give hints, but the new
player lack overview of what must be done (watch stats , analyse things...)
One want a reference book like the one in simicity 2000 !

- graphics contains anachronistic stuff. (potery and cars in market).
 I answered that currently in India nuclear and space technologies just
stand near traditional agriculture and shanties.
One idea is to say: you are the chief of a small developping country, choose your
way (sustanable or space) and take care of your people...

- birth rate control is hard to understand.
 Using different kind of buildings seems irrealistic to them.
 They expect a more subblte mechanism, 
 low price -&gt; people comes -&gt; more jobs -&gt; more money/taxes -&gt; prices rise
 -&gt; less people come. 
 Agreed, but this is hard stuff to manage. In RL birth rate is strongly
 linked to &quot;richness&quot; and political decisions to promote family planning.

 Maybe just explaining that different kind of houses is a summary for
 the above mechanism would be good ?

- people want to control money (give less than 100% funding for social....)
 instead of having to build/destroy buildings.

- They find difficult to understand why a building does not work. They
 would like clear messages explaining everything.
 Hmm, i m not sure i like to explain everything. Part of the fun is to think
 to understand what happens, but maybe i'm biased due to knowledge of the
 engine ?

That's all folks ! I hope i have forgot nothing, and respected what was said.
I think lincity-ng is in good shape and just need some small adjustments to be
perfect :-)


Cheers
Alain
