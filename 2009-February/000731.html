</I>Agreed, maybe we can even have special graphics for underfunded
buildings. We can use the same system for tracks, roads and rails. So
underfunded roads have less capacity. Visually holes can be visible in
the road/track surface.

&gt;<i> So, question:  If you guys decide that you want a building to be able to tell
</I>&gt;<i> a user why it isn't working:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. When should it generate a message?  Any time it's below 80% capacity?  Or
</I>&gt;<i> should it only offer the information if it's been low for a while.
</I>I think should only give a message if it's been low for a while (under
70%-80%). When the user ignores or misses the message it should wait
some time and then show the message again.

&gt;<i> While C
</I>&gt;<i> code into the MpsInterface doesn't or isn't set up to exploit it, I believe
</I>&gt;<i> that the actual panel getting written to is some fancy type of HTML-ish

</I>&gt;<i> or something (I need to do my homework and examine that code).  So I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> sure, please advise how you think this should work and maybe I can do it
</I>&gt;<i> while I'm touching that area of the code anyway (and I agree, have a config
</I>&gt;<i> option in userdata.xml to disable it).
</I>I think the text should appear in a bar at the bottom of the screen.
Different colors for different possibilities is a good idea.

Greetings,
Ivar.
