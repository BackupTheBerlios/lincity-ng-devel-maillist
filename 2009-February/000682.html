<PRE>Hi Daniel

Welcome in lincity-ng.
I'm not very active currently, but know the engine rather well and can try to
answer some of your questions :-)

Le lundi 2 f&#233;vrier 2009, Daniel Santos a &#233;crit&#160;:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I started playing lincity-ng a few weeks ago and have had a good deal of fun
</I>&gt;<i> with it, despite the fact that I have yet to win a game (I'm still learning
</I>&gt;<i> :).  None the less, I wanted to measure the dev team's interest in patch
</I>&gt;<i> submissions.  
</I>You can post your patches at <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/patch/?group_id=2929">http://developer.berlios.de/patch/?group_id=2929</A>
so that we can try them, and if interested integrated them in the code.

Patches that simplify the code, and increase readability are welcome now that
computers are much more powerful.
Also eliminating dead code (if some remains) is a good idea.

&gt;<i> So anyway, I've done a little development to:
</I>&gt;<i> * Add a config option for statistical display mode with the settings
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;percentage&quot;, &quot;values&quot; and &quot;both&quot; and added a new function void
</I>&gt;<i> mps_store_sddp(int i, const char * s, int cur, int max) to
</I>&gt;<i> src/gui_interface/mps.h and src/lincity-ng/MpsInterface.cpp to use in place
</I>&gt;<i> of mps_store_sfp.  This function, based upon the config setting displays
</I>&gt;<i> either a precentage (as mps_store_sfp currently does), values in the form of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;cur/max&quot; or both in the form of &quot;cur/max (p%)&quot;.
</I>Sounds good idea. Units are somewhat strange in the display, maybe percentages
would be better.

.../...
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've also made a few changes so far that actually alter game-play.
</I>Its frightening to change the engine, because it has lots of interactions, and
is globally non-linear (even if each module is quasi linear)

What is the aim ?
How big is the impact ?
Sustanability should be kept (or nealry kept) and also it must be possible
to win with rocket evacuation.
.../...
&gt;<i> * Adding a get_jobs2 function to src/lincity/modules/market.h/cpp to
</I>&gt;<i> eventually replace get_jobs.  This function will return the number of jobs
</I>&gt;<i> acquired and will acquisition less jobs than requested.  Then I plan to
</I>&gt;<i> modify all calls to get_jobs to accept what jobs it can get and attempt
</I>&gt;<i> production with a minimal work force rather than completely abort. 
</I>
If you don't have the workers you need, then maybe you can produce nothing.
I have thought a lot about this. Your patch would smooth the engine, making
the output more proportional to the workforce. Currently, there are
 discontinuities / hysteresis in the engine, and smoothing this would be a
big change.

&gt;<i> There are 
</I>&gt;<i> however a lot of nuances I don't quite understand yet, like the fact that the
</I>&gt;<i> current get_jobs will not return true unless the 150% of the requested jobs
</I>&gt;<i> are actually available.
</I>My understanding is: you need a large pool of workers in order to find the
people you need. This is done by the 150% (which is a very kind coeff) 

The engine has been created by a very clever guy, with many subtles things
like this hidden in many places (eg i love shanties management ;-).
It has done &quot;as simple as possible, but not simpler&quot; model of socio-economics
where imho he catched the essentials.


&gt;<i> * I plan on changing the text &quot;Jobs&quot; for mps_market to &quot;Workers&quot; to properly
</I>&gt;<i> reflect that this is a surplus of workers available.
</I>yes good idea. It clarify things for players.

&gt;<i> * Finally, I don't yet understand the locale framework and what needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> done to realign all the .pot translation files, as I've noticed that they
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly specify the source file names &amp; line numbers where each string  is
</I>&gt;<i> substituted.
</I>The strings are grabbed at compilation time (maybe if you activate one option, 
i dont remember) and the english reference file is updated automatically.
The script in src/tools/update_po.sh is used to sync everything with english.
The .pot file are build by tool which add the numbering in comments, and
can be edited with poedit (or whatever you like) to do the needed translations.
 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I'm mostly playing around at this point and learning the app &amp; concepts
</I>&gt;<i> behind the game design, but if any of what I'm doing can be of interest to
</I>&gt;<i> you guys, I would be more than happy to contribute some.  This is the 1st sim
</I>&gt;<i> game I've worked on and I'm rather enjoying learning from it. :)
</I>Enjoy playing and patching :-)
Also <A HREF="http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page</A> contains many
things (docs, whishlist ...).

Don't hesitate to subscribe to and post on the list before begining to one task :-)

Cheers
Alain.
