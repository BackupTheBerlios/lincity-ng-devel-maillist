Summary: Inexplicable population crash. 

Details: I'm an experienced SimCity 2000 player. I earned power plant tech, started building out my power grid. (thought my population was about 3,800).. Then I started having trouble lighting up my substations. I started tracking down the problem and found my population had crashed to nothing, I had lost most of my tech, and since nobody was paying for my infrastructure I was now a hundred million dollars in the hole (and no population). I thought it was food related so I set to import food, -- my farms had no workers... My city started burning down for lack of fire fighters. I managed to get my population up to about 2,000 and then it started dropping again and I couldn't figure out what the cause was. The people there had no desire to work for the power company. There was nothing I could do to get my population back to normal so I decided it was a bug and gave up.

Comment:
They could have died from pollution. Have a look at the gamestats. You can see there how many people died from starvation or pollution during the whole game. You can also look at the pollution overlay. You should not have people living in the red areas. You can use parks to fight the pollution.
