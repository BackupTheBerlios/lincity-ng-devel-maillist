<PRE>Bug #15307, was updated on 2009-Feb-23 13:23
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: LinCityNG
Category: confirmed
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: mqawasmi
Assigned to : none
Summary: Total population increase, housed decrease

Details: I am playing LinCityNG v2.0 on windows. My city population is increasing in a good way. At some point the economy start going down, after tracking the problem I found the following:
- The markets have ever thing needed
- pollution is minimal as I am running mostly an agricultural economy 
- Total population is increasing
- homeless population is increasing
- housed population is decreasing
- new houses stay at zero population

The result is that I don't have enough people to work, and economy start going down. The only thing missing from the markets is jobs, mostly it is below 1%

As I am trying to build a sustainable economy, I thought the problem could be a result of waste, so I built recycle bins, but that didn't help. 

Could that be related to transport network? I noticed the problem after I developed the transport network to include rails and roads

I have a saved game, if needed I can load it.

i just sent the saved game to admin, to see the problem I demolish one small building which is already full, and covered by water wells and market, then replace it with a new larger building

Comment:
Yes, there is enough water wells, and houses are in the range of the markets. Should I e-mail the saved game?

Comment:
Do you have enough water wells and are your new houses in range of your markets ?
Please provide us with a savegame so we can see the exact problem.
