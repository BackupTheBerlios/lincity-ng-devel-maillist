Summary: Inexplicable population crash. 

Details: I'm an experienced SimCity 2000 player. I earned power plant tech, started building out my power grid. (thought my population was about 3,800).. Then I started having trouble lighting up my substations. I started tracking down the problem and found my population had crashed to nothing, I had lost most of my tech, and since nobody was paying for my infrastructure I was now a hundred million dollars in the hole (and no population). I thought it was food related so I set to import food, -- my farms had no workers... My city started burning down for lack of fire fighters. I managed to get my population up to about 2,000 and then it started dropping again and I couldn't figure out what the cause was. The people there had no desire to work for the power company. There was nothing I could do to get my population back to normal so I decided it was a bug and gave up.
