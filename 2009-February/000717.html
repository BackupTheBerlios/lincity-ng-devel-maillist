<PRE>
I love the new trees &amp; grass visually.  I find it difficult to navigate
however.  I'm currently playing a game that's heavily forested and when I hit
H to hide the buildings I like to be able to see where every building is by
the squares at their bases, but the trees obscure large portions of this
making it difficult to figure out (much more so than on a more grassy or
desert area).  So I hope that some compromise can be reached that doesn't
remove the trees, reeds and grass that I really love.

Perhaps in certain view modes the tall terrain images (trees, reeds, etc.)
can be drawn first and then the squares drawn over them.  I know will look
really non-intuitive and non-3d though. :(  Maybe there's a way to draw the
trees so that they are drawn with a transparency over the squares where the
building foundations are?  The problem with this is that the background
(under the trees) will be darker than normal as the trees will be faded both
where they overlap and where they don't.  I don't know OpenGL very well at
all, but the only other way I know to avoid this is to draw all of the tall
terrain images first (trees, forest, etc.) and then draw everything a second
time, and draw the trees at half alpha on the second pass.  This would end up
causing them to be drawn twice, but then they would only be semi-transparent
where they overlap the building foundations -- for that matter, this would
work when rendering with or without hiding the buildings.

Maybe something similar can work for water too?  When generating a map that
has a lot of marshes, I also cannot see where they are unless two tiles are
joined making a more pronounced water image.  I basically have to attempt to
build something and hover to determine where they are (or go into an
alternate map view to see the water).
