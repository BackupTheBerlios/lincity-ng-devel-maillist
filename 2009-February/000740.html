<PRE>2009/2/8 Daniel Santos &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/lincity-ng-devel">javatroubadour at yahoo.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Thanks for the responses.
</I>No problem

&gt;<i> Can you do an Idiocracy style hospital?
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/idiocracy_hospital.jpg">http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/idiocracy_hospital.jpg</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, just a joke :)  But seriously, it sounds like a good idea.
</I>I've made an underfunded version of the hospital by changing some
textures. See this link :
<A HREF="http://img530.imageshack.us/img530/8214/hospitalunderfundedet3.png">http://img530.imageshack.us/img530/8214/hospitalunderfundedet3.png</A>
(image was to big to attach). The other social buildings will have the
same effects when underfunded. I hope you like it.

&gt;<i> Not to try to &quot;imitate&quot; simcity, but I do like the idea of a scrolling
</I>&gt;<i> marquee or something similar.
</I>I like that way of showing the text too.

&gt;<i> But I also like the idea of random events that
</I>&gt;<i> effect game play (I'm mostly thinking of Monopoly's Community Chest and the
</I>&gt;<i> events from an old Commodore 64 game called Mule).
</I>Do you mean disasters? I never used them in SimCity, because it hated
it when I finally had a nice city and sudden a hurricane destroyed it.
I only used them when I was bored (putting the city in fire and then
sending the fire-brigade to the fires). But others may like disasters.

&gt;<i> If such a thing were
</I>&gt;<i> implemented, I think it should be optional and you could determine the
</I>&gt;<i> frequency in the config.  In general, it should be a mixture of positive and
</I>&gt;<i> negative events and there has to be a big variety to keep it from getting
</I>&gt;<i> repetitive (so that part requires a lot of creativity).
</I>Agreed. Users should be able to turn off random events.

Wolfgang Becker wrote:
&gt;<i> The wiki is a nice place to work on such a document. But in the
</I>&gt;<i> end it should be part of the in game help system, too.
</I>Well, maybe I'd better improve the in-game help system then. Having to
maintain two different manuals wouldn't be a good idea.

&gt;<i> Budgets will add even more micromanagement. I don't think that is
</I>&gt;<i> much fun.
</I>I don't agree. Having the possibility to change the budgets will allow
the user to have more control of his city. The game can even be a bit
easier, because the user doesn't have to destroy buildings when he has
debts. Remember that one don't have to change the budgets, one can
just ignore these settings and leave them on the standard values.

Greetings,
Ivar.
