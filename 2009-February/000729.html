<PRE>2009/2/5 Alain Baeckeroot &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/lincity-ng-devel">alain.baeckeroot at laposte.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> - compared to simcity 2000 with graphics ala 3000.
</I>&gt;<i>  newcomers expect lincity to behave like simcity N.
</I>&gt;<i>  my guess = and so they are disapointed.
</I>&gt;<i>  We should be more different, and advertise it from the start of the game.
</I>Maybe we can add a line to the start menu which says that this game
doesn't work like Simcity or something like that.

&gt;<i> - sustanable development is a nice original feature :-)
</I>Sure it is.

&gt;<i> - lack of a reference manual: the building's help give hints, but the new
</I>&gt;<i> player lack overview of what must be done (watch stats , analyse things...)
</I>&gt;<i> One want a reference book like the one in simicity 2000 !
</I>I was thinking of starting an in-depth manual on the Lincity wiki,
which should explain every detail of the game.

&gt;<i> - graphics contains anachronistic stuff. (potery and cars in market).
</I>This can be fixed by having different graphics for buildings. I
remember Jaky has already made a patch for the market, but he hasn't
uploaded it yet (or I missed something).

&gt;<i> - birth rate control is hard to understand.
</I>&gt;<i>  Using different kind of buildings seems irrealistic to them.
</I>&gt;<i>  They expect a more subblte mechanism,
</I>&gt;<i>  low price -&gt; people comes -&gt; more jobs -&gt; more money/taxes -&gt; prices rise
</I>&gt;<i>  -&gt; less people come.
</I>&gt;<i>  Agreed, but this is hard stuff to manage. In RL birth rate is strongly
</I>&gt;<i>  linked to &quot;richness&quot; and political decisions to promote family planning.
</I>&gt;<i>  Maybe just explaining that different kind of houses is a summary for
</I>&gt;<i>  the above mechanism would be good ?
</I>We can try explaining this mechanism better, but I still think think
it works weird. It would be better if one can handle the population
size by taxes. I prefer the way Simcity 1 does this, by letting the
user assign residential zones (3 by 3 tiles), and then the game builds
houses on them.

&gt;<i> - people want to control money (give less than 100% funding for social....)
</I>&gt;<i>  instead of having to build/destroy buildings.
</I>That's a good idea in my opinion. A lower fund would result in a
smaller coverage of a social building (e.g. fire stations).

&gt;<i> - They find difficult to understand why a building does not work. They
</I>&gt;<i>  would like clear messages explaining everything.
</I>&gt;<i>  Hmm, i m not sure i like to explain everything. Part of the fun is to think
</I>&gt;<i>  to understand what happens, but maybe i'm biased due to knowledge of the
</I>&gt;<i>  engine ?
</I>I think we have to reckon with new players, who don't immediately
understand why a building doesn't work. Advanced players should be
able to turn help messages of if they want.

These are my thoughts about these user comments. I hope it's possible
to realize them, the only thing I can do is providing graphics, no
coding.

Greetings,
Ivar.
