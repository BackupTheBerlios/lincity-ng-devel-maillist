<PRE>Hi Jacky

Le mercredi 11 f&#233;vrier 2009, Jaky a &#233;crit&#160;:
&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the discussion about pollution in Bug #15177 several people said that the light industry pollution is too high. As I said in this bug report I propose to reduce the pollution from about 90/day to 1.8/day. I attached a patch to do that.
</I>hmm reduce from 90 to 1.8 seems huge !
If its possible to manage pollution 90 with parks, i don't think its good
to reduce this so drastically. Pollution _must_ be a (manageable) problem :-)
For very high tech (more than 200) pollution is not a problem. I have
not checked recently for tech near 50-100. 

&gt;<i> There seems to be a bug in the way the market burns waste. ATM it only burns waste if it is connected to a track. The second patch I attached fixes that.
</I>yes this is a bug !

&gt;<i> It also reduces the amount of waste burned from 70% of the market capacity to 10% of the market capacity. That way it is easier to see for the player that their markets are full of waste. The pollution/waste is also reduced slightly so that it is the same as when burning waste on the transport. 
</I>Yes, ok if 10% burn is greater than waste &quot;production&quot; each turn

btw, i'm in job travel for 1 week, so i probably won't check lincity meanwhile.
Alain
