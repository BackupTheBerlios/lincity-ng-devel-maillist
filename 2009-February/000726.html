<PRE>
I'm still working on my cleanup of the lincity sub-project that includes the
features I posted about before (i.e., adding a config option to control how
some values are displayed, either %, cur/max or both, etc.).  In the process,
I have discovered and exploited a good number of other areas for improvement:

* I've isolated a good number of duplicated (copy &amp; paste) code and have
re-implemented them using a single function in a more centralized location. 
* I now have new get_jobs() and get_stuff() functions that return the count
acquired, allowing a partial acquisition of resources instead of
all-or-nothing.
* The new get_jobs() supports the ability to specify an exact percentage of
qualified applicants.  The old get_jobs() function had similar functionality,
but used a hard-coded value of 67%.  Where I've replaced calls to the old
get_jobs() with the new function, I've hard-coded that value in the function
call (to 67%), but this can now be tweaked as desired to better fit each
industry (I'll be adding it as a #define in lin-city.h for each building).
* The new get_stuff() function actually eliminates 4 other functions, so
reduces code size.
* Added a new get_from_transport() function for buildings that ship &amp; receive
only from the upper two connection points.  Like the new get_jobs and
get_stuff functions, it too will return a partial amount.  It accepts
sufficient parameters to deduct the appropriate number of jobs used and scale
that number based upon how much is retrieved and also performs load
balancing, retrieving first from the transport that has the greatest
inventory.  All in all, it should greatly smooth the supply chain (not that I
perceived any irregularities while playing).  But most of all, it eliminates
more duplicate code as each module just has to call this function now to
retrieve a resource from connected transport.
* I've gotten a lot of interfaces cleaned up (removed a lot of function
prototypes for functions that were defined elsewhere and replaced them with
correct includes of the appropriate header files).
* Added a mechanism to track running statistics (for up to a month of
history) and I'm using that to replace the current &quot;Capacity&quot; display which
uses stale data (previous month).  This is in place for pottery, blacksmith,
mill and light industry thus far.
* Bumped save game version and added appropriate load, save and convert old
save game functionality for the running statistics data.

So now I've encountered a new challenge.  It seems that the code for heavy
industry is inconsistent and that the behavior it has been exhibiting may not
be the correct/desired behavior.  So here is an analysis of how
do_industry_h() behaves (as is now)

* Attempts to load ore from transport:
  o If stored ore is less than max and (x - 1, y) is transport that has any
ore then it attempts to provision 9 jobs.  If this is successful, then it
attempts to fill it's stocks, taking a maxiumum of one half of what is
available on transport.
  o If stored ore is still less max, it repeats the same process for
transport (if any) at location (x, y - 1).
* Attempts to load coal from transport:
  o behaves exactly the same as loading ore, except that 18 jobs are used to
load from each transport.
* Normal stuff so far, but here's where it gets wierd.  It starts with a
quantity of ore and uses either the full amount of what is available or
MAX_MADE_AT_INDUSTRY_H, which ever is lessor.  The name
&quot;MAX_MADE_AT_INDUSTRY_H&quot; would seem to indicate that this is for the maxiumum
amount of steel that's made and is defined to &quot;MAX_ORE_AT_INDUSTRY_H/16&quot;
evaluating to 625.  In practice, this is not the maximum amount of steel that
can be made in a day, the real maxiumum is 36.
* Next, to determine if we have enough raw materials to proceed with
production, it checks to make sure we've got ore (naturally) and that we are
storing less than 20480 units of steel (which is also oddly expressed in the
code) -- just to make things clear, it would take 560 days at full capacity
to create 20480 units of steel.
* If the previous conditions are met, then it makes 3 successive attempts to
allocate jobs, first using the desired amount, and then that same amount
divided by 2 and finally by 5 if the previous two attempts fail.  Here's the
kicker; the expression to determine the number of jobs to attempt to allocate
is &quot;((rawm / 2) / JOBS_MAKE_STEEL) + 1&quot;, where &quot;rawm&quot; is the amount of ore
calculated earlier.  So with the maximum allocation of ore (625 units), this
evaluates to 5 jobs.  This already seems funny to me because we just used as
much as 54 jobs to load ore and coal from transport.  If it can't allocate 5
jobs, it tries for 3 and then 1.
* If job procurement was successful, it calculates the amount of steel made
using &quot;rawm / ORE_MAKE_STEEL&quot;, for a maximum of 36 units.  If it used one of
the lessor job allocations, the amount produced is divided appropriately
(i.e., to 18 and 7 respectively).
* (it uses power or coal and sells steel to transport, but this is the end of
the analysis)

The definition of JOBS_MAKE_STEEL is as follows:
/*
  JOBS_MAKE_STEEL is the steel made per job at the steel works
  what's it doing here?
 */
#define JOBS_MAKE_STEEL 70

So if a single job is supposed to be able to make 70 steel, why do 6 jobs
make 36 in pactice?  My current course is to remove all bogus calculations
and re-implement it as it *effectively* behaves.  But I would greatly
appreciate some comment on this.  It appears that the code has been touched
many times, but maybe it's just confusing because the original developer
tweaked it several times to try to figure out what made sense and never went
back and cleaned it up.

Finally, heavy industry does not store jobs, I presume because they ran out
of fields to store the data.  I am freeing one of those fields since I'm
implementing the running statistics and removing the current and previous
month's capacity, so it would be nice to have it store some jobs, shielding
it a bit from an unstable job market.  I would appreciate some feedback on
that as well.

Thanks,
Daniel
