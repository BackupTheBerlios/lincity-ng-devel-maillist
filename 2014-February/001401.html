<PRE>Bug #19275, was updated on 2014-Feb-03 13:12
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: LinCityNG
Category: new
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: apoleon
Assigned to : none
Summary: lincity-ng 2.9.beta cannot be built twice in a row

Details: while I was packaging version 2.9.beta for Debian GNU/Linux, I discovered that it is not possible to build the game twice in a row. The reason for this is that some object and static libraries are not cleaned by jam.

It would be great, if those files could be removed by jam.

Here is some output that shows which files are affected.
