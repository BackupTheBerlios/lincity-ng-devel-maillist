<PRE>Hello guys.  I got to playing this game again (because it's fun and I've 
still yet to win) and, as usual, I eventually became frustrated with the 
difficulty in figuring out which way my jobs, food, etc. were moving on 
transport.  You can eventually figure it out by clicking on and 
observing the load of a good on each piece of transport, but it's very 
limited and a pain.  So hear ya go...

OK, so there's two patch sets here, one for 2.0 and one for the HEAD.  
The reason being is that the HEAD currently just crashes for me.  I hope 
you don't mind if I'm lazy and just include it all in one email.

Oh yeah, another thing is that looking at this code is always daunting 
to me.  It's hard to figure out which paradigm to use, since there are a 
number of conflicting ones.  Yes, I realize that it's in the process of 
being converted from C to C++, but, well, I don't mean to sound 
unpleasant, but I don't care for the approach being taken. :)  None the 
less, it's a very fun game with a beautiful interface, look &amp; feel and 
you guys rightly deserve kudos for that, good job!

Anyway, I went the C approach, even though the files I edited were all 
being com
