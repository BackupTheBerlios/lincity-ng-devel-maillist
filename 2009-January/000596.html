<PRE>Le mercredi 7 janvier 2009, Ivar ten Cate a &#233;crit&#160;:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> Trees would reduce the amount of pollution, like parks.
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think of this? 
</I>
i forgot half of the answer:

yes, trees should reduce pollution, _but_ pollution should not be suppressed
 ~ &quot;Nothing is created, nothing disappears, things are transformed&quot;.

What happens in RL is:
- some part of the pollution is bio-compatible, so it goes back in the
 ecosystem and is recylcled
- some part is not bio-compatible, so its is only transported, and either
 is diluted or accumulates somewhere.
 When it is diluted we consider it is not a problem (which is not necessarily
 true, see highly toxic CFC in polar zone)
 When it accumulates its is a very visible problem, for example in sites where
 there was a polluting industry the ground contains lots of highly toxic things
 and will stay desert for long and contaminate the environment with dilution
 and transport by water provided by rains.

Currently in lincity, only air transports pollution. I am trying to add water
transport along slopes. 
The ground maybe will need a stock capacity for pollution and we
will have all necessary thing for a real ecosystem simulator.

Last, it needs to be carefully coded, to prevent numerical artefact.
Currently, pollution is evacuated through the border of the map. 
I think correct and playable tuning would looks like:
- keep air pollution transport as it is (instantaneous effect)
- pollution from water should be seen after some 100 years
- pollution in ground evolves in some 1000 years

All this need to be discussed, and will take time if ever implemented, so
it could be for 2.2 or 2.4 ...

Alain
