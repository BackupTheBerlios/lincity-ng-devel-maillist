Summary: Crash when selecting a location to build water well

Details: Too bad I didn't think to save my game, I was almost at tech level 5 and hadn't saved. :(

So I seem to be able to reproduce it in a number of ways.  Basically, you zoom all the way, scroll all the way up as far as you can in the map, click the  build water well button and move the mouse around in the upper areas of the window (outside of the map area).  This occurs in both 2.0 and current svn (r1518)

(gdb) info locals
info locals
group = 41
size = 2
i = 0
j = 0
has_ugw = 0

It looks like it's failing because it wasn't designed to accept invalid x, y coordinates.

Comment:
It doesn't crash on my computer either. But the call to HAS_UGWATER on line 158 tries to access the map.info array outside of its boundaries, if the x and y value is outside of the map. Probably this is the cause for the segfault. 
map.info is also accessed for Ports, tips, oremines and parks. It could also crash for these buildings.

Works fine for me, I can't reproduce the crash here. Strange. Which 
compiler/platform do you use? Do you get the crash with other buildings, too?

As far as I understand the code, the invisible border is required so every 
building is surrounded by tiles. That way you don't need special cases for 
pollution and transport checks.

Comment:
Thank you very much for your detailed bug report. But your patch does not cover all the cases. We have to take into account the size of the building to prevent some part of the building being outside of the map. And the first usable tile starts with x=y=1 and the last one is at x=y=98. This is due to an invisible one-tile border around the map. I don't know why it exists. Maybe to prevent crashes due to off-by-one errors.

We can use the check from MapEdit.cpp line 243 which is used while actually building something. Updated patch:
