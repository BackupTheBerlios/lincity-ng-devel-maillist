<PRE>Bug #15128, was updated on 2009-Jan-26 00:59
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: LinCityNG
Category: feature request
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5

Summary: game save on crash

Details: It would be nice if the non-debug build saved the current game (or attempted) on crash.  With a reentrant crash handler, you can first attempt to save the game when a crash occurs and if you crash again, then go ahead and give up (you don't want to keep trying over and over).

Thanks

I caught a problem in my code, fixed it and checked it in to my repository, so just make sure you have rev 297 or later if you are interested these files. (I forgot to add an uninstall member function for the crash handler and there were parts of my code where the crash handler no longer was living object, but would have still attempted to use it).  Also, PlatformCrashHandler uses an Uncopyable base class, you can just ditch that or replace it with noncopyable if you're using boost, etc.

Comment:
If you have any interest what-so-ever, I have a rough crash handler class for posix w/glibc &amp; windows.  I wont promise it's anything near perfect, and you'll have to modify it (obviously) to fit your needs, but I did get it to print pretty backtraces using glibc's backtrace() and backtrace_symbols().  Hah! I just realized this is code that matze originally wrote (and I later hacked up :)!  Please pardon my invalid ssl cert though.

Comment:
Yea, I should do this on Glest Advanced Engine too (a game project I'm working on).  I'm a save-a-holic, so it would be nice if I could have more than 6 save slots anyway.  Maybe there could be a &quot;simple&quot; saved game mode and an &quot;advanced&quot;?  The simple just gives you the very easy to use slots we have now and the advanced lets you have any number of saved games, allowing you to choose an alternate name for them.  Thus, the save-on-crash game could be loaded via the &quot;advanced&quot; interface?  Just an idea.  I know that we can't always guarantee that a game saved from a crash handler will actually not be corrupted (and cause yet another crash), but I think it's better to give it a try than not (personally).

Thanks

Comment:
Sounds like a plan. This emergency save must not overwrite an existing game
because maybe that was the last working version of the city. On the other hand
a way for the player to continue the crashed game would be nice, too.
