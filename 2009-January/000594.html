<PRE>Le mercredi 7 janvier 2009, Ivar ten Cate a &#233;crit&#160;:

&gt;<i> Do you know how to add trees? It would be cool if the user could
</I>&gt;<i> select trees in the button panel and build them. Trees would reduce
</I>&gt;<i> the amount of pollution, like parks. What do you think of this?
</I>
Its looks like my secret plan for 2.x ;-)

Currently the nature of one tile is picked randomly in one table, which
depends on the distance to water and altitude (kind of &quot;realistic&quot; model),
which was roughly hand tuned to be playable and good looking.

So far only bulldozzed area becomes green again after some time, but we
could do random change each N turn (pick for one tile in its table) and
we would have a very similar map , but with living trees (roughly near water
60%trees, far from water or high = 10% trees, very high or no water = desert)

I thought of things like this, with a &quot;ecosystem simulator&quot;:
- distance to water and altitude impact land/trees. 
   I want to add pollution impact
- trees2 need to be surrounded by 2/4 tree1

Also the game stay simple, so in my idea, the player does not control the
land/forest (as in Real Life), but it can observe what happens, and take
care (or not).

I need to solve one problem with rivers and lake with the new terrain
generator, which is a bit difficult, but i think the most important is to
release 2.0 as it contains many new cool stuff (graphics, translations,
bridges, some bug fixes, code clean up and new file format more easy for
debugging and extenting....)
