<PRE>Hi,

I have noticed several things, which are missing or inaccurate in the help. 

Missing things are:
- there is no information that a port produces technology. Something like &quot;An active port produces as much technology as 4 schools.&quot; could be added.
- sport fields also increase the jobs provided by residences
- tips turn into useable land when they are full for 200 years

Some inaccuracies:
- the help for schools says &quot;You can see when a school is working in the usual way, by clicking on it, and every so often the animation will come to life.&quot;. But schools have no animation.
- The help for health centre says: &quot;They don't, however, use jobs as such. These are taken into account when calculating the extra jobs created by the reduction in sickness of the surrounding areas.&quot; But as far as I can see, health centres use real jobs.
- Why does the help for health centre say that it costs 60k per year ? 60k is the cost at tech level 277.8. 
- The windmill help stats that low tech windmills do not provide power to industries. That sound like high tech windmills would provide power to industries. But they do not do this directly. They have to be connected to a substation, which distributes the power. Is this a bug in the code or just not clear in the help ?
Maybe it should also be stated in the help that windmills provide power to mills, but not to recyclers.
