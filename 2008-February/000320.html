<PRE>Le mercredi 6 f&#233;vrier 2008, Michael Skiba a &#233;crit&#160;:
&gt;<i> I'm not sure, if we're really ready for a 2.0 counter...
</I>At least we can try.

What are the problems currently with new version ?

_Maybe_ we can release 2.0.linux in the right time, and take some additional
 time if needed for Windows and maybe MacOS if there are specific concerns.

Releasing soon for Linux seems easier to me because:
- killing 2 birds with one stone is great: I mean at the same time be in
 new debian stable AND ubuntu Long Term Support seems a nice idea.

- we can use command line (add more text in it)

- we can/should add a man page , including information about the change
 of directory, (this is a big change). Also we should add one page news.xml
 in the help system (and launch it automatically while there are empty slots
 in the new dir ?)

- ubuntu users have forums and will be abble to auto-help themselves in
 the (improbable ;) case we do something wrong. I believe debian users
 are even more abble to self-help

- i don't have windows

&gt;<i> I've some doubts, we set the expections to high - what do you think?
</I>No problem :)

waterwell branch is quite old, and there have already been near 100 000
download since 1.91.beta was released. Even if half of them are 1.1.2
this is still 50 000 for 1.91 with no bug reports except our owns.

opencity_0.0.5 will probably be part of next debian/ubuntu which is not
limited to perfect programs (at least it is currently in testing/unstable)

Lincity-NG is a really nice, polished and clever game.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I mean we're currently at 1.1.3pre and we just started breaking off 
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility from old lin-city code..
</I>
- old games can be imported, and are preserved, so compatibility is
 one way.

- the in-game cost for building a water well is nearly zero, so upgrading
 one city with it cost nothing (just 15 min)

- the transport change is very small (transports are now exchanging stuff,
 i consider this is a bugfix :)
  Nothing have changed if 
     - if you have only one kind of transport
     - if you have markets connected to 2 differents transports
  Also as buildings can pick/put stuff on transport, the only case where
  something change is when one have isolated transport meeting.
  I am 200% sure that nobody had problem in existing game due to this, 
  unless there is a bug there.

Last, there were significant improvements in graphics, translations and
having a deadline is motivating.

So let's go, i added a (temporary) page in the wiki
<A HREF="http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/TODO_for_2.0">http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/TODO_for_2.0</A>

let's fill it and then solve it quickly and durably ;-)

Cheers
Alain
