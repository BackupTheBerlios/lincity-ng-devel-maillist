<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; solarpower and windmill need jobs to work (50 and 10).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; They are awfully expensive compared to coalpower:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But they don't pollute. Clean energy is expensive.
</I>
Not in the future. Wind power has nearly reached the price of coal-power in regions with much wind and the price is still falling.

&gt;<i> &gt; - at low tech it is comparable with real life prices.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - but at very high tech (&gt;100) it is really not realistic, the ratio
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  price per kilowatt is too much favorable to coal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Limit bonus to tech 100?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I wonder if we should change this (either lower the cost or suppress the need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for jobs)
</I>I'd propose to increase the base cost and lower the multiplier for solar and wind energy. In lower tech-levels the price would be similar to what it is now, but it would not raise so much for higher tech-levels. 
Additionally I would propose a change in the formula to calculate the power production. It could start very low (lower than current production) but raise fast with increasing tech-level ( fast improvement while a technology is still new). Later the growth could slow down as the technology approaches a physical limit ( e.g. 100% efficiency).
Wind power could become cheaper than coal (maybe at tech-level 100) and solar power could eventually become cheaper than wind(around tech-level 200). That would also make high tech levels more attractive.
