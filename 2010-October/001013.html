<PRE>Bug #17644, was updated on 2010-Oct-20 16:47
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: LinCityNG
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: paxton
Assigned to : alainb
Summary: Fire protection won't 

Details: v2.0 on Ubuntu 9.04, installed via Menu &quot;Applications - add&quot;, so I did no alterations. Set the language to German.
Started with &quot;Good times&quot; (last option of the prepared games) and developed the city to sustainability. In the beginning I managed to achieve &quot;Fire&quot; sustainabiltiy but that has been interrupted several times by burning camps of the homeless. So I plastered the area within the radius of my fire stations with roads to drive them out (not nice, I know ;) but from then on fire sustainability has never returned.
Even as I gave fire protection to the whole map, and even as I finally erased all the camps and plastered the whole map with streets, the &quot;fire&quot; bar in the sustainability chart never rose the tiniest bit again. So it is impossible for me to win the game that way.
I can send you a saved file by mail if you need it.
Thanks.

Comment:
I found 2 zones without fire cover in the game you sent to me:
one x=1, y=20 to 40  (middle of left border)
one for x=64, y =2 and 3 (top border)

After fixing this, the fire cover works, and sustainability can be reached :-)

BUT, i agree the overlay is somewhat bogus, as it is impossible to see wether tracks are protected against fire or not.  This will be fixed in 2.1 release.

Comment:
Fire protection is supposed to work.

I bet there is one tile with no fire protection, but, please send us the game to be sure (i send you a mail so you have my address)
