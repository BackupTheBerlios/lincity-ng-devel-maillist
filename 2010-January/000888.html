<PRE>Greetings to all.

I am a young student interested in your project, mainly because I find it a
good simcity-like game and because it is open-source. However, I only got to
know today that this project isn't dead at all.

Why did I think it was dead?

Well, checking svn log as well as online commit info, it seemed that there
were no commits at all, and that those that existed were not important (i.e.
Compile fixes). Now today I went to the IRC channel where I was pointed to
this mailing-list and told that progress wasn't stalled at all. I've also
realized that now -- great!

So, here's my big question: Where are the recent changes kept; where is the
development branch? I'd like to be up-to-date. To study the code and
possibly change it, as I have been learning how to program for 3 years now
during my school-time, and consider myself to be an average programmer
(Particularly in the areas of C and C++).

I would also appreciate it if you could point me to a good documentation of
the project:
 * Directory structure;
 * Naming conventions;
 * Important classes and their purpose;
 * etcetera...

Thank you very much,

Jo&#227;o Ricardo Louren&#231;o, Jorl17
