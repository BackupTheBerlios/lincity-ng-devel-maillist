<PRE>2009/5/21 Willy Dumaz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/lincity-ng-devel">willydumaz at arcor.de</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I like both! especially the first one, it is absolutely beautiful! :)
</I>Thanks :)

&gt;<i> You could either replace the current market tile by it or use this tile
</I>&gt;<i> for a lower tech level.
</I>
The problem is the the first tile won't look well in a place with many
factories. In such places the second tile would look better. In
residential areas the first tile will look good, also in modern times.
Maybe one should be able the choose the building I wants to build, if
one has enough tech-level.

&gt;<i> the second one looks more like industry, could be confusing.
</I>
Maybe this is confusing the first time someone sees the building, but
afterwards one will recognise the building. First I wanted to make it
look like a modern supermarket, but as it also handles things like
coal and garbage I desided a depot would be better.

&gt;<i> maybe one way it  could  work, though, would be if the same coulour
</I>&gt;<i> scheme would appear in
</I>&gt;<i> all three markets, i.e. orange yellow green...
</I>
That might work indeed, I'll give it a try.

Greetings,
Ivar
