<PRE>2009/5/18 Willy Dumaz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/lincity-ng-devel">willydumaz at arcor.de</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> i&#180;ve worked out the draft of the new title screen I sent you some days
</I>&gt;<i> ago. you can find the new version here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.box.net/shared/lzhbzspuff">https://www.box.net/shared/lzhbzspuff</A>
</I>&gt;<i> it is not completeley finished yet, there will be some little
</I>&gt;<i> adjustments here and there. I decided to use the ingame graphics because
</I>&gt;<i> they are beautiful made and its good to keep a graphical theme
</I>&gt;<i> throughout the whole game. Critics welcome, tell me what you think! If
</I>&gt;<i> you like it, i&#180;d make the final version soon.
</I>
I really like it, the water, houses and hills look all great. Some
graphics are already outdated, like the tracks and the hospital, but I
don't think that's a big problem. I'm looking forward to the final
version. :)

&gt;<i> hey Ivar, I like the design of the icon you&#180;ve made, looks very fresh
</I>&gt;<i> and modern. But I am not sure, maybe it has a too different style
</I>&gt;<i> compared to the game? has a very different feeling. maybe we should try
</I>&gt;<i> using one of the buildings which are already in the game? so the
</I>&gt;<i> graphical style is consistent. don&#180;t know...
</I>
Indeed it doesn't really fit with the style of the game, but maybe
that will change with you new title screen. I wanted to redraw some
other in-game icons, so the whole game will be more fresh and modern.
Then the icon will fit better with the game.

I'll try your idea too, using some in-game buildings for the icon, to
see how it looks.

&gt;<i> With a new icon and a new title screen, the new Lincity Game will be
</I>&gt;<i> beautiful! :)
</I>
Sure it will :)

Greetings,
Ivar
