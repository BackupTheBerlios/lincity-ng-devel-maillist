<PRE>Hello again

I guess we should then postpone the SDL upgrade ;-)   it would be a 
major construction site.
For an upcoming betha I would I would still like to have.
1 xml formatted sound resources. This will make customization much easier
2 new scenarios, with modern file formats. Either port the old ones once 
more or make new ones?
3 hide binary saving from user. It is slightly faster but breaks easily 
with code changes. gzipped size is same as ASCII file.
4 hide saving in old file format from user.
5 move d-click info into DEBUG build

6 For the graphics I would like to suggest to render bridge tiles with 
transparent ground on top of the respective
edged water, grass or desert tile. That should fix the glitch when a 
bridge runs along the shoreline.

I will see if I can get 1 done in these days, 3,4,5 are small changes. 
For 2 I could provide a testgame.
For 6 the coding will be manageable, but I am not a graphics guy.
