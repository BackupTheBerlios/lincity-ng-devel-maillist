</I>Hi,
I've make a begin of test to implement build bridge with track dragging 
tool.
The building is not hard to code and it's possible to manage bridges as 
a type of transport with a water flag to let the simulation engine 
unchanged.
But in this case and without a special group for bridge, the 
neighbourhood of bridge tiles, cost and bulldoze managements have to be 
reviewed.
For example, I get green in water near the bridge or a cost of $1 to 
bulldoze a part of a track bridge...

We can also update engine to consider bridges as a transport.
Any comment from maintainers where is the best way to manage it ?
