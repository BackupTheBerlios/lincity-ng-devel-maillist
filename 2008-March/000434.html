<PRE>Le samedi 8 mars 2008, Ivar ten Cate a &#233;crit&#160;:
&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One problem I have while playing the game is that I can't build bridges
</I>&gt;<i> across rivers. Demolishing
</I>&gt;<i> water is very expensive, which makes the ability of building bridges across
</I>&gt;<i> rivers attractive. 
</I>I believe it was done on purpose :) as it is written in the (english) doc.

&gt;<i> I guess 
</I>&gt;<i> many users wants building bridges. Currently I have drawn an ancient bridge,
</I>&gt;<i> but I was wondering if
</I>&gt;<i> you want bridges and if it's possible to add bridges to the game. If that's
</I>&gt;<i> true, I am also going to
</I>&gt;<i> draw a modern bridge. I added the ancient bridge images to svn.
</I>
I like the idea of bridge. Now that transport are unified/simplified in the code
this should be easy to integrate.

I think the simplest (for the code) is to have 3 kind of bridge:
- track bridge / footbridge / wood bridge (nearly ala Indiana Jones ;-)
- road bridge (stone one) 
- rail bridge (your modern one)

with various prices... and need to be rebuilded if one wants to improve
transport.

Also an help page is needed, with explanation / draw for the approach ramp
on the ground. (i mean the bridge begins and end on ground tiles)
