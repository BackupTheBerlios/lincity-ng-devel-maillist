</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I have also one thing which can be added to the game: water irrigation in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; deserts. Water irrigation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; can be a good way for the user to get rid of deserts. I think it should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be something like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the user can build a water irrigation system (which I can draw :) ) on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; desert tile. Of course
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; a water irrigation system costs money and it should be placed near a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; water well or river. After some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; months, the desert tile turns in a grass tile and the water system goes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; away (automatically).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In that way a user can turn entire deserts in lucrative ground, on which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; he can build parks, farms
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and other stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe &quot;desert&quot; is a too hard word, and &quot;bare ground&quot; would be better.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't like the idea of suppressing desert, because real desert cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; turn into a rich land. It is desert because there is little water and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nearly no soil. Richs farm are where there is water, good climate for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; crop, and a lot of good soil, no matter how much technology and money you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; invest.
</I>&gt;<i> hm.. although I think it could be technically possible(with a whole lot of 
</I>&gt;<i> money and technologie, i.e. there are modified seeds which can grow in very 
</I>&gt;<i> unfriendly environments.. but that's something for the scientists and the 
</I>&gt;<i> future :) ).
</I>I am not sure that this is possible, nor that it will be in any future.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In another therad I raised the idea about Ozon - one idea of mine was that 
</I>&gt;<i> this Ozon could have an effect on the territories. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So how about introducing something like a &quot;climate&quot; - i.e. with increasing air 
</I>&gt;<i> pollution/Ozon the percentage or factor for the appearance of bare ground 
</I>&gt;<i> could be increased too, what do you think about such an Idea?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It will be for 2.+
I have tons of ideas like this, as my university studies were about
modeling in oceanography and climate, but Lincity must stay a nice
simple and clever game :)
Implementing a climate model is too difficult and would eat CPU and memory.

I think we don't need an additional parameter like ozone, as we already
have air pollution.
My initial idea for doing waterwell (and it is still my aim) was just adding
effect of pollution that &quot;kill&quot; land and make deserts, and/or pollute water
with the same consequences (hence the need for altitude to know were the
water goes, and this part is not yet finished).

Doing more subtle pollution needs more work, and some time to experiment
and tune to keep playability... so it will be later.
