<PRE>Le lundi 24 mars 2008, magicfox a &#233;crit&#160;:
&gt;<i> &gt; I hope it's possible to add these bridges to the code (I can't do that, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know nothing of programming:(
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'll draw the rail bridge soon.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Greetings, Ivar.
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> I've make a begin of test to implement build bridge with track dragging 
</I>&gt;<i> tool.
</I>nice

&gt;<i> The building is not hard to code and it's possible to manage bridges as 
</I>&gt;<i> a type of transport with a water flag to let the simulation engine 
</I>&gt;<i> unchanged.
</I>very nice

&gt;<i> But in this case and without a special group for bridge, the 
</I>&gt;<i> neighbourhood of bridge tiles, cost and bulldoze managements have to be 
</I>&gt;<i> reviewed.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, I get green in water near the bridge or a cost of $1 to 
</I>&gt;<i> bulldoze a part of a track bridge...
</I>A new building need a new group, so 3 more groups for 3 bridges.
Then for each new types are needed for specifying the tile used (access ramp,
orientation)

Maybe we can put bridge (not access ramp) also in group_water (or is_water...)
so connect_rivers will find the correct water tile. 

Also a new loadsave_version must be set to prevent loading newer games with
older versions (this gives unmodifiables tiles). 
loadsave.h #define WATERWELL_V2 1322     (i used svn commit number)
I can do this if you don't feel confident in modifying loadsave stuff.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We can also update engine to consider bridges as a transport.
</I>This should need to just add bridges in 
transport.h XY_IS_TRANSPORT

Something alike is defined in
lin-city.h #define GROUP_IS_TRANSPORT(group) \

These 2 are nearly redundant, i had no time to check if we can suppress one, but
the idea is to keep only one. I'd prefer to keep transport.h.


&gt;<i> Any comment from maintainers where is the best way to manage it ?
</I>transport stuff and connect rivers can become performance critical. My last
simplification of code gave a significant slowdown, but i kept (in comment)
original code unrolled and much faster. So, if it is needed we can do it
again...

Alain.

PS: btw, i messed my computer up while doing upgrade to debian/testing to be
sure that everything work smoothly &lt;:o) I'm currently fixing this...
