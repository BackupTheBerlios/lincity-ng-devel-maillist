<PRE>Hi,
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I hope it's possible to add these bridges to the code (I can't do that, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I know nothing of programming:(
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'll draw the rail bridge soon.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Greetings, Ivar.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've make a begin of test to implement build bridge with track dragging 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tool.
</I>&gt;<i> nice
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The building is not hard to code and it's possible to manage bridges as 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a type of transport with a water flag to let the simulation engine 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unchanged.
</I>&gt;<i> very nice
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But in this case and without a special group for bridge, the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> neighbourhood of bridge tiles, cost and bulldoze managements have to be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reviewed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example, I get green in water near the bridge or a cost of $1 to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bulldoze a part of a track bridge...
</I>&gt;<i> A new building need a new group, so 3 more groups for 3 bridges.
</I>&gt;<i> Then for each new types are needed for specifying the tile used (access ramp,
</I>&gt;<i> orientation)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we can put bridge (not access ramp) also in group_water (or is_water...)
</I>&gt;<i> so connect_rivers will find the correct water tile. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also a new loadsave_version must be set to prevent loading newer games with
</I>&gt;<i> older versions (this gives unmodifiables tiles). 
</I>&gt;<i> loadsave.h #define WATERWELL_V2 1322     (i used svn commit number)
</I>&gt;<i> I can do this if you don't feel confident in modifying loadsave stuff.
</I>Thank for your proposition, I'll let you to manage it when I'll be quite 
ready with build managements.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We can also update engine to consider bridges as a transport.
</I>&gt;<i> This should need to just add bridges in 
</I>&gt;<i> transport.h XY_IS_TRANSPORT
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Something alike is defined in
</I>&gt;<i> lin-city.h #define GROUP_IS_TRANSPORT(group) \
</I>This sound simple, cool ,-)
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These 2 are nearly redundant, i had no time to check if we can suppress one, but
</I>&gt;<i> the idea is to keep only one. I'd prefer to keep transport.h.
</I>These are not exactly the same, lin_city.h has GROUP_POWER_LINE too as a 
transport.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any comment from maintainers where is the best way to manage it ?
</I>&gt;<i> transport stuff and connect rivers can become performance critical. My last
</I>&gt;<i> simplification of code gave a significant slowdown, but i kept (in comment)
</I>&gt;<i> original code unrolled and much faster. So, if it is needed we can do it
</I>&gt;<i> again...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Alain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS: btw, i messed my computer up while doing upgrade to debian/testing to be
</I>&gt;<i> sure that everything work smoothly &lt;:o) I'm currently fixing this...
</I>
Thanks for yours explanations, I'm going to take care of your 
performance advice.
Some work have to be done before I can present a decent implementation 
of bridges.
So Ivar, you have some time too to create new tiles or enhance existing 
tracks for example ;-)
