<PRE>(I'm not sure the exact wording at the end)

This was followed by an SDL parachute and a core dump; I couldn't find any useful information with lincity-ng.

Luckily, xlincity started OK, but it showed a weird save file in slot 9.  Once I deleted that, lincity NG was OK.

It looks like NG tried to read this file before even displaying the start screen, and crashed while reading it.  I guess the error message came from libxml.

Yea, the return value of sscanf isn't even checked to make sure that the expected number of arguments were read.  I like the idea of using text instead of binary to avoid all sorts of alignment and byte order issues and then gzipping it, but I think it needs some sanity checks.

I propose something something that allows you to pass the format string and destination pointers but also verifies that the number of arguments you passed were actually read.  I've added  a data member to the Map_Point_Info struct and I would rather that data member be printed on the same line as all of the others, so I inserted it there.  But this required me to play with the string to essentially advance the pointer the length it was read.  It would be nice if there was a mechanism that would allow you to make multiple calls to read data from a single line.

In addition to checking the return value of sscanf to make sure that we really read the number of arguments we expected, there should also be other sanity checks to make sure that the game data is valid, to a point that is reasonable.  One of the problems with the old C-style designs is that they can be hard to validate.

Comment:
I can confirm that the game segfaults with a broken savegame. I uploaded a savegame which produces a crash to <A HREF="http://files.mail.ru/eng?back=%2FDRYMXD.">http://files.mail.ru/eng?back=%2FDRYMXD.</A> Unfortunatly I don't see an easy way to fix it. There are no sanity checks in the load_city_2 function. There are not even checks for EOF.

Comment:
I just did a quick test, if I do something like 
  gzip -cd 1_file | head &gt; 2_file

I still get the segfault, but not the parser eror.  The behavior is the same whether I gzip the result or not:
--
OpenGL Mode 1024x768
Fatal signal: Segmentation Fault (SDL Parachute Deployed)

No, I deleted it trying to find the problem.

I think the program created this file, then crashed, when started while /tmp was 100% full.

Comment:
Do you still have the broken 9_currentGameNG.scn? Starting 1.1rc2 works
fine here, no matter what garbage I write in that file. Worst case I end up
with an empty map without any people. But no crash.
