<PRE>Bug #14577, was updated on 2008-Sep-29 08:27
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Summary: LinCityNG segfaults randomly in game

Details: At random times, lincity will segfault.
It doesn't seem to be related to anything I am doing at the time.

The machine is otherwise stable, and I don't have any problems with other apps, libs, etc.

$ lincity-ng
Starting lincity-ng (version 1.1.2)...
[/home/calum/.lincity] is in the search path.
[/usr/share/games/lincity-ng] is in the search path.

Segmentation fault

This didn't happen with the previous version I was running.
Running Gentoo's version games-simulation/lincity-ng-1.1.2
Previous version that worked fine was lincity-ng-1.1.0

Please advise as to how I can help to solve this.

Old windmills produce between 463 kW (techlevel 3%) and 652 kW (techlevel 45%) of power. A residence with 200 inhabitants needs at least 630 kW of power. The problem is that this power has to come from ONE grid (is this a bug or a feature?). As all old windmills are on different grids the power would have to come from one windmill which would have to be build after techlevel 40%.
I usually don't even try to get power to the residences till I get a power grid. I only use the old windmills to power some farms.

Comment:
Well, I'm not at the stage where I can build other power stations or transmission lines.

Perhaps I have too many windmills, but those big 200 resident places don't even seem to be OK for power with about 7 of them around.

Anyway, I'm no expert on the game, so it's likely I'll make mistakes while building my city. :)

Comment:
Old style windmills produce mechanical power which is good enough to power some buildings. So they are power grids, too. With MAX_GRIDS=128 you have too many windmills. I don't see why you need so many but maybe we should increase that limit anyway.

Heya,

Patch applied, and crashing upon new windmills has stopped.
Thanks for that.

It all seems to be working, apart from now, when I build anything, I get a message complaining about too many power grids.

Well, I'm not at the tech level yet to build power stations and power lines, so joining them up is something I can't do.

And to have it complaining with every build is too much.
Perhaps it could check if I have the tech level to build power grids before moaning?

Also, can windmills be part of power grids? I didn't think so.

I was not able to reproduce the crash on my computer, but I found an off-by-one error in power.cpp, which gets triggered when you reach the maximum number of power grids. Can you please test, if the patch at <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/patch/index.php?func=detailpatch&amp;patch_id=2588&amp;group_id=2929">http://developer.berlios.de/patch/index.php?func=detailpatch&amp;patch_id=2588&amp;group_id=2929</A> fixes your problem. Maybe you also have to apply the patch from <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/patch/index.php?func=detailpatch&amp;patch_id=2586&amp;group_id=2929">http://developer.berlios.de/patch/index.php?func=detailpatch&amp;patch_id=2586&amp;group_id=2929</A> .

I have put it here:

Apparently, it can only be downloaded 10 times, so save it down :)

If I add a windmill between the 3 farms and the market, it crashes every single time.

Let me know what else you need from me.

Can you please upload a savegame and describe how to reproduce the crash. With this information I could try to debug the problem.

Comment:
OK.

It's definitely to do with power.

I installed the latest version from SVN, and that didn't make much difference.

I have a lot of windmills, and adding two more makes it crash every time.
Also, it crashed when I was trying to move to coal power stations

No, it's not that I have no citizens left.

I have got it narrowed down to a saved game, where I can reproduce it every time.

I have run strace, and can't see anything immediately obvious.

I've renamed my .lincity/ and .lincityrc, and only copied the one saved game in.

Perhaps I can upload the game somewhere, and tell the steps I use to make it segfault?

I see this in dmesg when it crashes.

Just guessing here, but do you have no more citizens left? Then you hit bug #12684 <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=12684&amp;group_id=2929">http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=12684&amp;group_id=2929</A>
