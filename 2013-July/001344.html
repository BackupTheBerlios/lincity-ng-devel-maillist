<PRE>Hello Amit,

I believe the most recent version of Lincity should work nicely for 
creating new scenarios. If you deactivate &quot;binary mode&quot; in options
the gz. files will be compressed ASCII text. You cannot easily change 
the WORLD_SIDE_LEN in a savegame because the number of stored tiles must 
fit. Also all statistical quantities like population will be updated 
every day, month or year. Cheating on them is rather useless.
However if you change the techlevel, total money or peoplepool in a .gz 
savegame, that works nicely. I did that many times for testing stuff.

The current implementation is that old format savegames can be read only 
partially. I did not care about providing a translation from int1...int7
to the state in every specific Construction class. To avoid 
total_population == 0 all residences are provided with 5 people at 
construction. You may want to boost that for converting scenarios more 
quickly.
initiaialization of tech_level and money would need to be done in 
cleargame() in initgame.cpp.
If you set those inside loadCityNG() in the MainLincity.cpp ine 130 it 
should also work independent of the actual format that was loaded

For the engine performance, the simulation now runs through a vector of 
active modules, it is independent of mapsize. I dont think you can 
possibly run into a performance problem up to 10k active constructions. 
However Graphics is the bottleneck, especially if you zoom out on a huge 
map. Savegame size also becomes a matter with huge maps.

I hope I could help with that.

Cheers
