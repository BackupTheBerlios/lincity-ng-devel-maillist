<PRE>Bug #12209, was updated on 2007-Oct-18 22:41
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: LinCityNG
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: plueschinger
Assigned to : none
Summary: Strange amounts of coal in markets, like 16375%

Details: Hello

When I build a windmill, directly on the left side (border) of the field of the game, in the nearest and some other (not all) markets, the amount of coal changes from for example 20% to strange amounts between
-65000% and 65000%, It looks for me like an &quot;unsigned int&quot; number.

I can reproduce this behaviour, I didn't tried it with other borders of the field.

My system: Fedora Core 7
Lincity-ng version: 1.1.1-2fc7
so it's version 1.1.1, the rest are just some rpm-dependency fixes.
I would have attached the saved game files, but I don't now how to do it. If you are interested, I will send them to an administrator.

Sorry for my bad english,
regards
Plueschinger

Comment:
I didn't compiled lincity-ng myself, I got it from the fedora-repository,
And gcc-c++ has the same version as gcc, which is not installed on my computer.

Hello wolfgangb

The compiler is called 
gcc-4.1.2-2.27.fc7, so it must be gcc-4.1.2

I only can reproduce it in this  special game, in other games
I had a look for this, but it didn't happened again.

Thanks for your answer

Regards
Plueschinger

Comment:
Can't reproduce it here. Which compiler did they use to build the package?
