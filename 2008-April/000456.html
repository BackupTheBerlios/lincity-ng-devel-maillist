It is a good start, but there are still some things:

* It is possible to build partial bridges. You should have to build
  the whole thing at once.
* Couldn't open file 'gui/build_bridge_yn.xml'. Do we need a dialog at
  all? Maybe that causes the partial bridges for me.
* If you bulldoze a part of the bridge the rest just stays there.
  The whole bride should be destroyed at once.
* Bulldozing the bridge also destroys the river. Water should stay.
* Is is possible to build railroad bridges even if there is no room
  for the ramp. No incomplete bridges again.
* 'Can build' indicator is wrong.
* No idea if the costs for building and maintenance are balanced.
* Prevent user form building crossroads with bridges. 
  Probably already solved when partial bridges are impossible.
