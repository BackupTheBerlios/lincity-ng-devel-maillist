<PRE>Hi,
&gt;<i> * It is possible to build partial bridges. You should have to build
</I>&gt;<i>   the whole thing at once.
</I>What's the matter, the player isn't he the architect of the city ?

&gt;<i> * Couldn't open file 'gui/build_bridge_yn.xml'. Do we need a dialog at
</I>&gt;<i>   all? Maybe that causes the partial bridges for me.
</I>As I explained, we have a problem at compilation time where this file is
truncated to zero length.
When it is present you are prompted one time to build the bridge and
only one section is build because dialogue can't handle many tiles.
I plan to manage a stack to avoid this problem on the first build.

&gt;<i> * If you bulldoze a part of the bridge the rest just stays there.
</I>&gt;<i>   The whole bride should be destroyed at once.
</I>&gt;<i> * Bulldozing the bridge also destroys the river. Water should stay.
</I>&gt;<i> * Is is possible to build railroad bridges even if there is no room
</I>&gt;<i>   for the ramp. No incomplete bridges again.
</I>This is an unchanged behaviour, you got desert on bulldoze.
Bulldozing only one part of a bridge with the rest intact doesn't hurt
me at all but this my opinion.

&gt;<i> * 'Can build' indicator is wrong.
</I>What do you mean ? color of cursor ?
Do you have checked the new build cost calculation ?

&gt;<i> * No idea if the costs for building and maintenance are balanced.
</I>I have set the parameters of track/road/rail bridges to 200K/500K/1M and
600K/1.5M/3M per section on water at maxi level.
What is your idea about ?

&gt;<i> * Prevent user form building crossroads with bridges. 
</I>&gt;<i>   Probably already solved when partial bridges are impossible.
</I>I not sure that the player wants to build a field of a same transport
near each other but the fact is you can obtain very artistic shapes with
that. ;-)

&gt;<i> Tsch&#252;&#223;,
</I>&gt;<i> Wolfgang
</I>
Of course the bridge patch is open for review/add-on/correction and I'm
interesting about all opinion.
Salut
