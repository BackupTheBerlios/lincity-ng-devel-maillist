<PRE>Hi,
&gt;<i>     Here is the first patch to manage track and road bridges.
</I>&gt;<i>     Bridges are build by using track/road dragging on the water.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've tested your patch and it worked. Dragging tracks and roads results 
</I>&gt;<i> into a bridge. I found one problem: the bridges aren't complete, there 
</I>&gt;<i> are some pieces missing. Look at this image: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://img119.imageshack.us/img119/2388/lincitybridgesuh0.png">http://img119.imageshack.us/img119/2388/lincitybridgesuh0.png</A> (the black 
</I>&gt;<i> dots indicates where I started dragging the track/road). There were no 
</I>&gt;<i> problems with (noticeable) performance loss. Good work! :)
</I>
I can't reproduce your problem with water in the middle of the bridge.
The bridge section can be also build section by section in the water and 
the connect_transport function do the job.

The first time when you build a bridge, you are prompted by a dialogue 
to confirm or not the construction. The positive answer is stored in 
global variable (build_bridge_flag).
At the first time, just the one section of the dragging tool can be 
build directly. The problem is with dragging tool and dialogue.
We're waiting for the answer of player and just only one tile coordinate 
is stored.
May be we need and it's better to push in a stack all tiles of dragging 
that are dependent to the answer.
It's a bit more complicated but I'll have a look to that.

&gt;<i>     For a road or track section between 2 bridge sections (and
</I>&gt;<i>     entrances), we need a pillar bridge section with green; for the
</I>&gt;<i>     moment I have toggled it to bridge (without over cost).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you mean something like this: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://img86.imageshack.us/img86/7579/roadbridgepg1em8.png?">http://img86.imageshack.us/img86/7579/roadbridgepg1em8.png?</A>
</I> &gt;
Yes is that ! :) (for the track and rail bridges too)
May be the green near the water doesn't need to be a real square.
Thanks for your job too ;-)
