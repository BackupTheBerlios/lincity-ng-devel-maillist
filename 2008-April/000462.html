<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * It is possible to build partial bridges. You should have to build
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   the whole thing at once.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What's the matter, the player isn't he the architect of the city ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It looks broken. Visual feedback indicates unconnected transport,
</I>&gt;<i> for the engine they are connected. But maybe it is not that important.
</I>I think that the player will take care to keep the transport connected 
and if we have place the look is correct too.

&gt;&gt;<i> As I explained, we have a problem at compilation time where this file is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> truncated to zero length.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What problem? Anyway, I removed the dialogue code for now, it also
</I>&gt;<i> enabled bulldozing water without warning.
</I>If you change the file data/gui/dialogs/build_bridge_yn.xml,
the compilation fails with:
XSLTProc data/gui/build_bridge_yn.xml
runtime error: file data/gui/dialogs/dialogs.xsl line 118 element copy-of
Variable 'buttonbar' has not been declared.
xmlXPathCompiledEval: evaluation failed
         xsltproc -o data/gui/build_bridge_yn.xml 
data/gui/dialogs/dialogs.xsl data/gui/dialogs/build_bridge_yn.xml
...failed XSLTProc data/gui/build_bridge_yn.xml ...
...removing data/gui/build_bridge_yn.xml
...failed updating 1 target(s)...

and the file data/gui/build_bridge_yn.xml is overwritten with a size of 0.

May be the dialogue isn't important, I'm not be insistent with that.

&gt;&gt;<i> This is an unchanged behaviour, you got desert on bulldoze.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Removing a bridge for 1M and restoring water for a similar sum
</I>&gt;<i> sounds too expensive. I changed it so you can bulldoze just the
</I>&gt;<i> bridge.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * 'Can build' indicator is wrong.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What do you mean ? color of cursor ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. Fixed in SVN, too.
</I>I saw, thanks.

&gt;&gt;<i> I have set the parameters of track/road/rail bridges to 200K/500K/1M and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 600K/1.5M/3M per section on water at maxi level.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What is your idea about ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Too expensive IMO. Just bulldozing the water is cheaper that way. Is
</I>&gt;<i> 1000 times the cost of the same transport on land realistic?
</I>You set per section bridge to 1K/100K/500K and 3K/300K/1.5M at a level 
of 100%. It's correct for me.
1.5M is greater than bulldozing water but river must stay connected with 
a bridge.
