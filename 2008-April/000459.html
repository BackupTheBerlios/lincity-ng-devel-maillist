<PRE>Hi

i have not tested it very hard, i 'm finishing the water stuff, and will
look deeper to the bridges after.

Le samedi 19 avril 2008, magicfox a &#233;crit&#160;:
&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * It is possible to build partial bridges. You should have to build
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   the whole thing at once.
</I>&gt;<i> What's the matter, the player isn't he the architect of the city ?
</I>Yes, not really a problem, even if it would be nicer to build a whole bridge.

But, i can't build a full brigde, i always lack one or 2 access ramp (rev 1438)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Couldn't open file 'gui/build_bridge_yn.xml'. Do we need a dialog at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   all? Maybe that causes the partial bridges for me.
</I>&gt;<i> As I explained, we have a problem at compilation time where this file is
</I>&gt;<i> truncated to zero length.
</I>&gt;<i> When it is present you are prompted one time to build the bridge and
</I>&gt;<i> only one section is build because dialogue can't handle many tiles.
</I>&gt;<i> I plan to manage a stack to avoid this problem on the first build.
</I>I have nothing prompted. I just draw a road from land over river to land,
and i have a partial bridge.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * If you bulldoze a part of the bridge the rest just stays there.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   The whole bride should be destroyed at once.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Bulldozing the bridge also destroys the river. Water should stay.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Is is possible to build railroad bridges even if there is no room
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   for the ramp. No incomplete bridges again.
</I>&gt;<i> This is an unchanged behaviour, you got desert on bulldoze.
</I>&gt;<i> Bulldozing only one part of a bridge with the rest intact doesn't hurt
</I>&gt;<i> me at all but this my opinion.
</I>The bulldoze fix should be rather easy to do.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * 'Can build' indicator is wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> What do you mean ? color of cursor ?
</I>yes, over rivers selected tiles are &quot;red&quot; they should appear &quot;blue&quot;.
This is a test in 
engine.cpp:int is_allowed_here(int x, int y, short type, short msg)

&gt;<i> Do you have checked the new build cost calculation ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * No idea if the costs for building and maintenance are balanced.
</I>&gt;<i> I have set the parameters of track/road/rail bridges to 200K/500K/1M and
</I>&gt;<i> 600K/1.5M/3M per section on water at maxi level.
</I>&gt;<i> What is your idea about ?
</I>more than 1M is more expensive than buldozing water.
I think bridge should be less than this, more like
200K 400K 600k , as one need to buldoze it for upgrade, and it
will be water again after buldoze
