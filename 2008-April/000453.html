<PRE>&gt;<i>     The patch vs svn rev.1436 is included, it now implements track,road
</I>&gt;<i>     and rail bridges.
</I>&gt;<i>     The build cost display is updated to manage bridges.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nice. But I still have the problem I described some emails ago. Maybe I 
</I>&gt;<i> haven't patched your patch the right way (this is the second time ever I 
</I>&gt;<i> used a patch). How I've patched it: I've placed your patch in the trunk 
</I>&gt;<i> directory (working copy), then I opened the terminal and used the 
</I>&gt;<i> command: patch &lt; track-road-bridge-vs1436.patch. The problem is that the 
</I>&gt;<i> patch couldn't find some files, after which I had to type in the path to 
</I>&gt;<i> the file. Is this normal, or did I something wrong?
</I>&gt;<i>

Hi,
After a svn checkout, gunzip the patch then move it to lincity-ng/trunk/
You have to use -p0 option to leave the paths of the patch unchanged 
like this:
patch -p0 &lt; track-road-bridge-vs1436.patch
After the compilation, I saw that we have a problem with automatic xml 
generation and the file data/gui/build_bridge_yn.xml is overwritten with 
a size of 0.
As a workaround, back-up it _before_ compilation then restore it later.

I'm looking the manage a stack of tiles for dialogue in dragging mode 
but I'm not ready with it. The first time, build one bridge section in 
the water, answer yes and then later you can build all the bridge with 
dragging at the same time.
