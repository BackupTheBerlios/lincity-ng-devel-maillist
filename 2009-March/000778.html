<PRE>Hi , it seems there are some trouble with attached file .
This is the content :


 *The Lincity-ng nuclear power plant project *


 *Introduction *


 * This project is created to help with the implementation*

* of the nuclear power plant , ' NPP ' called from now on .*


 * This is a brainstorming project , so every input is welcome .*


 The requirements


  *Some resources are needed to make it all work*


 * Water *: used to cool the reactor , so the NPP needs to be close to a
river ( maybe using pipelines )

 The water doesn't get polluted , even the opposite is proven in real life .


  *Comments :**put your comments here*


  *Fuel *: Uranium , how to get it ? Maybe mining .

 Uranium needs to be enriched ( *plutonium-factory* )


  *Comments :**put your comments here*


 Positive

  The NPP creates large amounts of energy ( power ) and doesn't

 have much waste , but the waste is dangerous


  *Comments :**put your comments here*


 Negative


  There's a need for a *nuclear waste storage facility*

 Maybe nice for a high tech level , the ability to recycle the waste and use
it in a *nuclear fusion power plant*


 * Comments :**put your comments here*


 Possible scene's

  Radiation leak : a *nuclear waste storage facility *has a max. storage
capacity , if this gets crossed , it will leak .


  *Comments :**put your comments here*


 * *Meltdown : If the NPP isn't provided with water , it will heat up ,
causing at first radiation leak and at the end a total meltdown ( NPP is
destroyed , huge pollution )


  *Comments :**put your comments here*


 * *Bad maintenance case : If the NPP doesn't get used anymore and you don't
remove it , it will start leaking radiation .


  If you remove the NPP , the ground can't get used for farms for several
years .


  *Comments :**put your comments here*


 *General comments :*


 * **Comments :**put your comments here*


Greetings ,

Bart
