<PRE>Le 07/03/2009 &#224; 15:45, Bart Van Loy a &#233;crit :

Hello Bart, welcome


&gt;<i>  *The Lincity-ng nuclear power plant project *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *Introduction *
</I>&gt;<i>  * This project is created to help with the implementation*
</I>&gt;<i> * of the nuclear power plant , ' NPP ' called from now on .*
</I>
&gt;<i>  * This is a brainstorming project , so every input is welcome .*
</I>

preliminary :
The wiki contains many things that will never be implemented.
I believe a general discussion about the improvements and evolution of 
lincity-ng is needed, i'll post soon a new mail thread :-)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The requirements
</I>&gt;<i>   *Some resources are needed to make it all work*
</I>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Water *: used to cool the reactor , so the NPP needs to be close to a
</I>&gt;<i> river 
</I>true
&gt;<i> ( maybe using pipelines ) 
</I>uhh ! i've never heard something like this in RL, and pipelines are not 
implemented.

&gt;<i>  The water doesn't get polluted,
</I>There is significant thermal change, that modify ecosystem, to such a point 
that there is a &quot;crocodile farm&quot; on the Rh&#244;ne river, because water is warm 
enought for these beasts ! 
<A HREF="http://eng.lafermeauxcrocodiles.com/">http://eng.lafermeauxcrocodiles.com/</A>
This is thermal pollution. (it can allow foreign species to live, including 
viruses, bacterias, mosquitos, algae ...)

&gt;<i>  even the opposite is proven in real life 
</I>I strongly disagree. Do you have references ? 

&gt;<i>   *Fuel *: Uranium , how to get it ? Maybe mining .
</I>&gt;<i>  Uranium needs to be enriched ( *plutonium-factory* )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   *Comments :**put your comments here*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Positive
</I>&gt;<i>   The NPP creates large amounts of energy ( power )
</I>

&gt;<i>  Negative
</I> 
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   but the waste is dangerous
</I>This is very negative (not positive as in your post ;-)
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   There's a need for a *nuclear waste storage facility*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Maybe nice for a high tech level , the ability to recycle the waste and
</I>&gt;<i> use it in a *nuclear fusion power plant*
</I>This need a specific nuclear waste transport too !

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Possible scene's
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Radiation leak : a *nuclear waste storage facility *has a max. storage
</I>&gt;<i> capacity , if this gets crossed , it will leak .
</I>We know very little about storage of nuclear wastes. It is a very good troll 
topic :-)
I believe nuclear wastes cannot be stored safely, because they last for tens 
of thousand years and no human building is older than 5 000 years (not to 
speak of very recent buildings)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * *Meltdown : If the NPP isn't provided with water , it will heat up ,
</I>&gt;<i> causing at first radiation leak and at the end a total meltdown ( NPP is
</I>&gt;<i> destroyed , huge pollution )
</I>in 2007 or 2008 summer, some nuclear plants were stopped in France due to lack 
of water for the cooling system. no melt down :-)

Meltdown (ala Tchernobyl or Three Miles Island) need additional hazard / 
fault.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * *Bad maintenance case : If the NPP doesn't get used anymore and you
</I>&gt;<i> don't remove it , it will start leaking radiation .
</I>one need to recycle all nuclear fuel and contaminated material, and manage  
the wastes somewhere. 

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   If you remove the NPP , the ground can't get used for farms for several
</I>&gt;<i> years .
</I>several ?  several thousands years probably.
Chemical pollution lasts for dozens years.

I have planed to manage pollution in the ground (the data structures in 2.0 
allows this) and pollution transport with water (and exchanges with the 
ground and air) but this is not implemented yet.

&gt;<i>  *General comments :*
</I>
* Money *
Nuclear plants are very expensive to build (billion euros)

*  Client to buy production *
Nuclear plant produces GW, and linicty town is too small to reach such need.
One nuclear plant would probably be too much for the town.

* time scale *
Buildings does not get old in lincity, they last forever, but this is not a 
problem (we can consider that they are rebuilded regurlarly, as in Real Life)

This *must not*  be the case for nuclear plants, which lasts near 50 years, 
and then need to be retired, which causes the problem of nuclears wastes and 
contaminated material management (uranium and tons of concrete). 

If this is a real pain in the game (forbidding some part of the land for long 
time, cost a huge amount of money, and sometimes causes very bad hazard)
then i agree that nuclear plant can be integrated in the game, and will 
improve the clever educational aspect of the game about a very actual hot 
topic ;-)  (in france we have lots of nuclear plants that will be retired 
soon, currently the only choice was to increase their lifetime by 10 or 20 
years, and do nothing else !)

If the nuclear plants are eternal, i'm strongly opposite to implementing them, 
at it would hide the main problem or wastes management.

Cheers
Alain
