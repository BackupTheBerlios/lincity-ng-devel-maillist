<PRE>Hello LinCity-NG folks and fans

I have started a new job, and i m moving next week, so i currently have not
much time for Lincity-ng, and guess it will last until october.

I have merged the recent changes in waterwell branch, and i think it could
be qualified as &quot;alpha&quot;:
- basic water management features are implemented:
	- &quot;Look&quot; change: no more empty land: trees and green and water everywhere.
	- people needs water (water well have a range)
	- &quot;underground water&quot; is shown: tiles with no underground water are
		 yellow/brown like desert. 
	- farms and commune production output is proportional to the 
		underlying water: farm = 4x4 = 16 tiles, 
		if it has only 8 with water =&gt; output is divided by 2)
- 2 extreme scenarios were done extreme_arid and extreme_wetland 
	(random village is in between), 
	I am interested to verify that they are both playable (should be harder
		than standard random village)

It should be &quot;bugfree&quot; &lt;:o)

There is one big TODO for graphics:
you will see that the icon and the tile i draw are hmm somewhat naive, and
 far below Lincity-NG very high quality graphics.
I did my best, but i m totally incompetent in drawing
	data/images/tiles/waterwell.png
	data/images/gui/buttonpanel/waterwell.png

The next feature i want to implement need more deep work, i have already
gathered some documentations and thoughts about it but it will take
some times before it work again...

So i think the rev 1240 can be released as lincity-ng-1.2_alpha01 for heavier
testing, and it could become 1.2, and the next major feature add could be 1.3.

Cheers, and congratulations for more than 1 million downloads :)
Alain
