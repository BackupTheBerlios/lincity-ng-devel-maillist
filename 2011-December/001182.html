<PRE>Hello everyone!

Few days back I sent a little patch for music handling to the new 
mailing list. Because there wasn't any responses, I decided to subscribe 
also to the old lincity-NG mailing list. So this mail is cross-posted. 
Apologies for that.

I have coded a little bit more now in christmas time and the new music 
system has developed nicely. Someone should now test if my modifications 
really work. Is there any bugs? Recource hogging?

Attached patch should work with svn revision 1618 (the newest one). Also 
attached is music theme file default.xml. It should be in 
&quot;music/default/default.xml&quot; with the old songs.

Here is what works now:

  * It's possible to create several music themes in 'music/' folder via 
subfolders or alternatively using just different xml-files.
  * Theme can be read from xml file, but game should work also with 
plain music files.
  * It's possible to play different songs in different tech-levels (for 
example after windmills have been invented)
  * Game loops through all the songs. (No more infinite City Blues.ogg ;)
  * There is simple command for changing between the tracks. (Not 
implemented in GUI)

Future plans:

  * Transport control buttons ingame
  * There isn't any way to change music theme from GUI
  * Search music themes from LINCITY_HOME (or whatever it is)
  * Make xml file more flexible to allow grouping songs by tech level.
  * Playlist starts from beginning after visiting Options screen. This 
is because game restarts.
  * Randomize option for songs could be reasonable?
  * Maybe there should be a menu music different from game music?
  * A whole new musical score for Lincity-NG! I have few themes sketched 
already.

I'm doing this in my spare time because I really like the game, but got 
tired because of archaic music system. Hopefully you like my modifications?

All comments and ideas conserning the future plans are welcome!
</PRE>
