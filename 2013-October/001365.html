<PRE>Hello Everyone,

I would really like to include SDL related stuff from src/lincity. But I 
have no idea how to accomplish this.

I have tested a work-around with void* instead of Mix_Chunk* implemented 
for blacksmith only. Does anyone know
how to for instance &quot;#include lincity-ng/Sound.cpp&quot; inside 
&quot;lincity/lintypes.h&quot;? The sound worked but somehow
all animation stopped.

I would need that to load the *.wav directly into arrays of each 
ConstructionGroup. Constructions (aka modules) can than choose on their own
a sound to play. Later the same mechanism could be used for the 
data/images/tile graphics.  Just put the pngs to the folder and then 
modify /lincity/modules/whatever.cpp to actually use the nth image in 
animation. Then there would no longer be the need
for global type management. Adding new graphics should become much more 
simple to handle.


cheers
Khristian
