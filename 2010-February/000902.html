<PRE>Hey,

2010/2/6 Alain Baeckeroot &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/lincity-ng-devel">alain.baeckeroot at laposte.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I dont understand what you are saying.
</I>&gt;<i> Are you talking of the lake surface in 3D view ?
</I>&gt;<i> I agree it should be flat, lets says we see the bottom of the lake, not the
</I>&gt;<i> surface of it.
</I>&gt;<i> But the river are not flat, they follow the local slope, they are the real
</I>&gt;<i> rivers which correspond to the topography of the map (as in RL).
</I>Yes, I meant the lakes. Off course rivers can have slopes.


&gt;<i> Maybe the 3d view will just be an &quot;experimental&quot; options, and not visible
</I>&gt;<i> for the standard game ? &#160;What do you (and other) think ?
</I>&gt;<i> I find this view very addictive, so also very frustrating because
</I>&gt;<i> it break some graphics, (for example the really nice bridges just
</I>&gt;<i> look bad in 3d view)
</I>After putting so much effort in it, it would be a pity not to have
this in the standard game. It definitely improves the gameplay.

&gt;<i> I wanted to see this 3d, and hope this can (re-)motivate other people,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see only one solution for keeping current tiles:
</I>&gt;<i> - warp them to insure continuity of the ground
</I>&gt;<i> - maybe draw &quot;warped-ground&quot; first, and building without ground ?
</I>
That might work, but buildings without ground placed on slopes would
look weird, especially with big buildings. I think buildings on slopes
should have some sort of foundation under them, like in OpenTTD.

&gt;<i> I think this is the maximum we can do with current isomectric view and
</I>&gt;<i> tiles, and that jumping to a real 3d is not feasible soon (and i am
</I>&gt;<i> not even competent to estimate the workload)
</I>
I agree. 3D is too much work (I would need to redraw every tile). 2D
is fine. Personally I think using isometric tiles for hills is the
best and easiest way to draw hills (like in OpenTTD and other ancient
tycoon games).

&gt;<i> I saw you draw other tiles while i was away from Lincity, great job again :)
</I>Thanks, I haven't drawn anything for Lincity lately, but I think of
doing some new tiles soon :)

Greetings,
Ivar
