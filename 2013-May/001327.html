<PRE>Hello,

I am trying to understand the codebase of Lincity-ng and I mostly get it
but I have some questions.

First - Debugging.

I tried getting the code base to work in Windows. After setting everything
up I get SDL.h not found - I tried everything under the sun but still
nothing. So for now I have started working in linux. I got the lincity-ng
setup in Eclipse (so that I can easily navigate the code) and it compiles.
But I was wondering how can I debug the code? I tried using gdb (and also
DDD). But in DDD it shows the source code of main() and I can follow the
code line by line only till SDL_Init() - as soon it hits it I loose my
keyboard and mouse to the game context. And I cannot debug further. How do
you think I should proceed further?

I was going through the Jamfile and I saw that there are different profiles
configured. And one for 'Debug' - Do you reckon I should do that? But I
dont think I could go line by line with the code ( it mostly consist of
#ifdef DEBUG and std::cout, right?? )

Second - How and where the mouse interactions with components handled??

I went through the main() - I found the where keyboard input is handled.
Also how mouse is used to navigate in the city. But where or how is the
mouse interaction with the components handled. Maybe I overlooked
something. ( I am trying to change the population model in the game)

Looking for the reply. Thanks.
