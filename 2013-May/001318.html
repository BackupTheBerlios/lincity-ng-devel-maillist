<PRE>Hello,

Was compiling from src in windows 7 and Mingw. I am sure I have installed
all the libs and dependencies. As it './configure's and compiles
(partially). Just a side note - I have lincity compiling in linux (ubuntu
VM). So I have something to compare against.

Currently I dont understand :

1) SDL.h ( or others) are not found. I have all the includes correctly. I
am attaching the configure output

<A HREF="http://pastebin.com/PcuKQRrW">http://pastebin.com/PcuKQRrW</A>

and the jam build step

<A HREF="http://pastebin.com/nxKm7axG">http://pastebin.com/nxKm7axG</A> -- (Part 1) - Some parts skipped - I dont why
- mkdir sometimes doesnt work correctly.  Around line 150.


        mkdir -p &quot;./build/i686-pc-mingw32/optimize/src/gui\PainterGL&quot;

...failed MkDir1 ./build/i686-pc-mingw32/optimize/src/gui\PainterGL ...
...skipped &lt;T!src!gui!&gt;PainterGL\PainterGL.o for lack
of&lt;dir&gt;./build/i686-pc-mingw32/optimize/src/gui\PainterGL...
...skipped &lt;T!src!gui!&gt;PainterGL\TextureGL.o for lack
of&lt;dir&gt;./build/i686-pc-mingw32/optimize/src/gui\PainterGL...
...skipped &lt;T!src!gui!&gt;PainterGL\TextureManagerGL.o for lack
of&lt;dir&gt;./build/i686-pc-mingw32/optimize/src/gui\PainterGL...
MkDir1 ./build/i686-pc-mingw32/optimize/src/gui\PainterSDL


<A HREF="http://pastebin.com/z7L2ffbK">http://pastebin.com/z7L2ffbK</A> -- (part 2) -- Where it shows SDL.h: no such
file or directory. I think its not in the pastebin file (didnt print).

Here is the screen shot -
<A HREF="http://i1268.photobucket.com/albums/jj568/amitahire/sdl-h-nada.png">http://i1268.photobucket.com/albums/jj568/amitahire/sdl-h-nada.png</A>

I had a hard time installing SDL_mixer and PhysicsFS(oh the nightmares!) -
but finally did it. And I searched on Google for SDL not found issues (they
are a lot) - also implemented them (including the path even though it was
correct) - But still nada. Hence I turn to you guidance.

2) Also it doesn't seem to compile and runthe included xmlgettext tool.

...failed C++ ./build/i686-pc-mingw32/optimize/src/tools/xmlgettext\main.o
...
...skipped xmlgettext.exe for lack of &lt;T!src!tools!xmlgettext!&gt;main.o...
...skipped &lt;T!data!&gt;locale/gui\messages.pot for lack of xmlgettext.exe...
XGetText actions too long (max 2046)!


Can anyone help or guess what I am doing wrong here? I am pretty sure I got
all the libs installed, linked and included. I am also including the
configure output (<A HREF="http://pastebin.com/Y86nZg3k">http://pastebin.com/Y86nZg3k</A>) and jam build output(
<A HREF="http://pastebin.com/NegG8794">http://pastebin.com/NegG8794</A>) from my linux compilation which works
perfectly. Any help or pointer will be appreciated. Thanks.
</PRE>
