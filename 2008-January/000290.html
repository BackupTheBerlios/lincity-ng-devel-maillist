<PRE>Hi everybody

Currently different transports does not exchange material when they meet/cross
each other. One need an intermediary market to do this.
I find it very un-natural for track/road (when i was in Senegal is took cars
and buses on tracks, and donkeys on roads :-)

Also, as all buildings can pick/put stuff directly from/to rail (without market
used as a railstation) so it is hard to argue that road and rail should not
exchange things when they cross/meet.

I would like to change this, and either:

- allow all exchanges between transport.
  This should change very little in the gameplay, and will probably not be
  noticeable for old games, but would prevent some trouble for new players.

- allow exchanges only between track and roads
  AND
  change behavior of rail and force use of markets as rail-stations (of
  course except for the building who need connections)
  This is a bigger change, but it can give better control on the transport
  for example with only one market at each end of a railway, you know what
  happens. I guess that with all my current games this would change nothing
  as i have many markets along railways....
  This need some translations changes too in rail.xml and market.xml

What do you think ?
Greetings.
Alain
