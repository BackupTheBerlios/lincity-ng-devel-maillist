<PRE>Hi Luca

I agree with what Wolfgang said, and want to add that :

- i still do stuff on lincity-ng, even if it is not visible or released 
yet :)

- i have little time for this, and can't distract myself with other game 
related stuff

- i already tried to help people coming to us with &quot;seems-good&quot; ideas or 
project, but only lost my time so far. So i am very &quot;cold&quot; and won't do 
any effort until i see something, then i may reconsider things.

more answer below :

Le 01/09/2011 03:30, Luca Pancallo a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The proposal is to create an alliance between selected opensource
</I>&gt;<i> projects to gain more visibility and to gain more players/developers. I
</I>&gt;<i> think it can speed up some of our developments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&quot;our&quot; developments ?
It is a good idea to gather people, with developpers and artists

&gt;<i> Will be great if we could have an IRC discussion in the next days with
</I>&gt;<i> you and any other active dev. You can find me in irc.freenode.net with
</I>&gt;<i> the nick of &quot;Talad&quot;. I think a live conversation will be much quicker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>discuss what ?

&gt;<i> I think Lincity has a very good start, but needs to be polished and
</I>&gt;<i> improved to be fun.
</I>
Your detailed feedback is welcome, at least by email, or even better in 
the wiki or/and bug reports  (i don't give you url's to see if our web 
site is clear enought or causes trouble ;-) )

Please don't feel discouraged by my answer, and keep on doing your idea, 
this is how opensource project work.

Best regards
Alain.
