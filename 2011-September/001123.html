</I>Yes, I saw no activity in development, so I thought it was dead. If it's 
still alive that's good news.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Will be nice if one of them could contact me at this email.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually the mailing list works better for development related stuff

</I>&gt;<i> the list.
</I>I'm ok with the mailing list for general info, but then I would like to 
discuss the details with some active developers. The site will be 
launched soon, and I don't want to disclose all details to the public 
now, I prefer to keep it to a restricted number of people only.

&gt;&gt;<i> The topic is a website of opensource games I want to make, and I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wanted to include also lincity, but I need to understand if someone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is still interested in improving it/developing it further.
</I>&gt;<i> Lincity NG? We should probably release the stuff sitting in SVN.
</I>&gt;<i> It might need some work and it has been some time. Maybe do a beta
</I>&gt;<i> first. Now when do I have some vacations for that? Weekends are full
</I>&gt;<i> anyway. So this might take some time.
</I>
The proposal is to create an alliance between selected opensource 
projects to gain more visibility and to gain more players/developers. I 
think it can speed up some of our developments.

Will be great if we could have an IRC discussion in the next days with 
you and any other active dev. You can find me in irc.freenode.net with 
the nick of &quot;Talad&quot;. I think a live conversation will be much quicker.

I think Lincity has a very good start, but needs to be polished and 
improved to be fun.

Regards,
   Luca.
