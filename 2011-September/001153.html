<PRE>Hello.

I've been following the project and this mailing list for quite some time
now. I also sent in a couple of patches that I think got accepted about one
and a half years after I'd sent them.

My question is quite simple: What's the status of Lincity-NG? What features
are being worked on? Can we expect it to get closer to the last simcity-true
game series (simcity 4)? Can we see it go in a different direction, with
more buildings and a more intuitive display of the data, for instance? What
about some kind of netplay (I'm sure having a server and just sending out
some data once in a while and keeping in sync wouldn't be too hard to
implement if you designed the code)?

And if progress isn't being seen, are there any other simcity-like games
which you'd recommend? I know this is probably a bad taste question, but I
really enjoyed lincity-ng when I first played it. Then I waited. And waited.
And waited. And nothing new came. I get that it follows the simcity1 (2?)
design instead of the 3000 and 4, but I kind of miss those games and would
like to see an open-source alternative. I always hoped some fork of
lincity-NG would come up to do just this, but not even the project itself
seemed to move forward.

Lastly, is there some extensive documentation on the game?

Thanks,

Jorl17
