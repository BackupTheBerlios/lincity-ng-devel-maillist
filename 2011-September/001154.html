<PRE>Hello

Le 08/09/2011 04:12, Jo&#227;o Ricardo Louren&#231;o a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Hello.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been following the project and this mailing list for quite some time
</I>&gt;<i> now. I also sent in a couple of patches that I think got accepted about one
</I>&gt;<i> and a half years after I'd sent them.
</I>
i remember your nickname, but can't find which patch you sent :-(
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My question is quite simple: What's the status of Lincity-NG? What features
</I>&gt;<i> are being worked on?
</I>
Personnally i am working slowly (mostly on my laptop in train while 
going to work) on the following things
1 - improve water management and add pollution transport with water, 
(sadly actual with fukushima) which was the reason for adding waterwells 
and new map with altitude and real rivers.
2 - As a side effect i am trying to add a new interface page for land 
generator, but i am really bad in c++ so i took time to got something 
very far from perfect, but i am not far from something usable.

3 - i also made some improvements to improve maxspeed that i will commit 
soon. (re inline general_transport).

Maybe i should commit everything in an 'experimental&quot; branch, so other 
developper can help/teach me :)

I have other ideas,  but i want to commit at least (3) and (2) and work 
on (1) before anything else.



&gt;<i> Can we expect it to get closer to the last simcity-true game series (simcity 4)?
</I>
I dont know the simcity game series, and do not care :)

&gt;<i> Can we see it go in a different direction, with
</I>&gt;<i> more buildings and a more intuitive display of the data, for instance?
</I>I did a draw of a new interface i would like (cut paste in gimp), and 
tried some modifications, but nothing clean currently/

I am also gathering more documentation, to have more realistic ordrers 
of magnitude (including surface of buildings wrt production)

One personal wish would be to have several cities (lets say 3) with 
different settings. Maybe a first step on that direction can be done 
with pre defined scenarios for example
- 1 rich + high-tech + low interest rates + low population + green
- 1 poor + low-tech + high interest rates + lots of shanties + desert

or with a improved interface for starting new game (more settings...).
The main problem for me is that the game uses *hundreds* of global 
variables, and i am not good in C (and very bad in C++) as i only learnt 
fortran 20 years ago :)

&gt;<i> What
</I>&gt;<i> about some kind of netplay (I'm sure having a server and just sending out
</I>&gt;<i> some data once in a while and keeping in sync wouldn't be too hard to
</I>&gt;<i> implement if you designed the code)?
</I>
I think netplay requires the same modification as my multi-city whish ?
I don't see how it can be multiplayer (one city each ? echange wia 
ports?) but i like this idea.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And if progress isn't being seen, are there any other simcity-like games
</I>&gt;<i> which you'd recommend? I know this is probably a bad taste question, but I
</I>&gt;<i> really enjoyed lincity-ng when I first played it. Then I waited. And waited.
</I>&gt;<i> And waited. And nothing new came. I get that it follows the simcity1 (2?)
</I>&gt;<i> design instead of the 3000 and 4, but I kind of miss those games and would
</I>&gt;<i> like to see an open-source alternative. I always hoped some fork of
</I>&gt;<i> lincity-NG would come up to do just this, but not even the project itself
</I>&gt;<i> seemed to move forward.
</I>
it is slowly moving.
One thing i really want is to use a trac instance (either on sourceforge 
or fedorahosted) as i am really tired with the berlios obsolete tools 
(no decent ticket, separated wiki, no attachment....)
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, is there some extensive documentation on the game?
</I>The wiki is the only extensive documentation.

Maybe it could be good to improve Doxygen, but i am afraid i messed it 
up one day i was on nerves ;-) so maybe check the configuration before 
the commit when i added Docygen comment in each files (one line at the end)


Cheers
Alain
