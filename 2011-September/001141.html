<PRE>Bug #10457, was updated on 2007-Feb-22 14:59
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: LinCityNG
Category: confirmed
Status: Closed
Resolution: Fixed
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: alainb
Assigned to : none
Summary: Some 3D animations alignment wrong

Details: lincity-ng 1.1, build on linux + nvidia-glx-dev, 1024x768
Communes, Mills, Light and Heavy industries animation are bad aligned. So the building moves up and down when the animation shows activities.

Hi Jacky

Thanks for your analyse. I arrived to the same conclusion recently ;-) and rediscoved the bugfix by resizing all images of one family to the same size  (also a multiple of 16 to prevent zooming problems)

Your link as expired, but i have resized tiles, so no worry.

I think of removing all the complicated and broken images.xml stuff, and instead impose image size to the artists.

Comment:
I think there are two reasons for this behaviour: The first one is a bug in zoomSurface from SDL_gfx which creates textures which are 1 pixel two small. The other reason is the way the PainterSDL::drawStretchTexture function handles non-integer values for the size and the upper left corner of a texture. Both of them are rounded up with the result that the position of the lower right corner is changed as well. But the lower right corner is used in GameView.cpp to position the image. So the lower right corner changes for different images of the same building, because they have different sizes and some are rounded while others aren't. This causes the moving of the images.
The second reason can be fixed by rounding down the X and Y Values of the upper left corner while the size is rounded up. This way the rounding chancels each other out.
As a workaround for the bug in SDL_gfx we could check if the size of the zoomed texture is correct and try again with a different zoom factor if it isn't.
To avoid this problem and workaround we could also change the sizes of the images so that all images of the same building have the same size. It did that for most of the images. You can download them at <A HREF="http://files.mail.ru/eng?back=%2F37A9BJ">http://files.mail.ru/eng?back=%2F37A9BJ</A> (9.1 MB). I didn't change the monument, coal-power-plant, tip and rocket, because they are difficult to change and you don't see the moving images because they don't have an animation. Some of the images changed from colormap to fullcolor because I didn't find a way to preserve the colormap with imagemagick. The shadows of the modern windmill also changed, but this change is only visible in gimp, not in the game.
If you don't like the changed images and prefer a patch to work around this issue, please tell me.

Comment:
When running OpenGL mode it works here. (lincity-ng --gl)
But in SDL mode the buildings are jumping (lincity-ng --sdl)
I use Nvidia, too.

Blacksmith too.

I have checked the data/images/tiles for the blacksmith and they have not the same size, and aligment is different. But i m completely dumb with gimp to fix this
