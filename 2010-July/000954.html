Avery, 

i quickly added several comments (its late here, i need to eat and
improve the landgenerator, and check several things and sleep)

Le 28/07/2010 &#224; 21:41, Avery White a &#233;crit :
&lt;...&gt;
&gt;<i> A Low Impact Development (LID) is a water resources 'trick' used to help
</I>&gt;<i> rainwater get into the ground so that it doesn't stay on roads, stagnate
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. on a parking lot), build (i.e. and cause flooding), etc. These kinds
</I>&gt;<i> of things have to do with the sustainability of the watershed...to make
</I>&gt;<i> people more aware of this (and what can be done), I would like to add some
</I>&gt;<i> parameters to a custom map that will determine the effectiveness of LID
</I>&gt;<i> placement.
</I>
There are 2 map generators :
 the traditional one, with Y like rivers
 the new one, available from svn, but not yet released

I am speaking of the new one (and need to check if i corectly added altitude
for old map imported in recent version)

In the map generator there are no horizontal land (it is possible, but
very unlikely)

From graphic people, one tile is 10mx10m

The visible part is 98x98 (WORLD_SIDE_LEN = 100 ,and we use a gray border)
 <A HREF="http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/LinCity_Engine#Map">http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/LinCity_Engine#Map</A>

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I want to add checkbox menus (i.e. like the market) to some of the
</I>&gt;<i> structures - players will check mark LID's that they would like and the
</I>&gt;<i> map's effectiveness values will determine how good of a decision that
</I>&gt;<i> actually is. For my little project, I'm going to strip down much of LinCity
</I>&gt;<i> for a kind of proof-of-concept-just-for-show-project-toy example.
</I>
yes, easy to do in the engine, most of things are called from
src/lincity/simulate.cpp
	do_time_step
		simulate_mappoints

there are very few exceptions (call from GUI for launching rocket)

&gt;<i> However,
</I>&gt;<i> it would be cool to integrate some of this post-project. With the topography
</I>&gt;<i> in place, this could get very interesting. I'll be trying to play around
</I>&gt;<i> with the map files by hand (unless you have a more efficient option
</I>&gt;<i> available offhand)...
</I>the file format is (src/lincity/loadsave.cpp -&gt; save_city_2)

 one header = file's version
 one line per tile 
	=&gt; tile (x,y) is written at line N = 1 + 100 * x + y
 then game stuff

&gt;<i> could you give me some instruction how to use the
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard interface for map manipulation (in the meantime)?
</I>I have not yet finished, i try to do it tonight as a separate tool
(but i need to eat first ;-) )
 
&gt;<i> I use vim so
</I>&gt;<i> terminal-text editing shouldn't be a problem.
</I>yes

Alain
