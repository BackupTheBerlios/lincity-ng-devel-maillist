Le 07/03/2010 &#224; 11:21, Wolfgang Becker a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;MiniMap overlay mode&quot; button cycles through five different modes.
</I>&gt;<i> Normal, transparent map overlay, map only, elevated, elevated with opaque
</I>&gt;<i> overlay. IMO a bit too much. What about an extra height on/off button?
</I>I agree 5 modes are too much, and a new button could is welcome if we 
add this &quot;3d view&quot;

&gt;<i> Or is the new renderer too experimental to be part of 2.1? Then we add
</I>&gt;<i> the button later.
</I>It works nicely for me in various screen size and zoom factor.
The only default i saw is with maximum zoom, sometimes the on-screen-southest
tiles (near x=100, y=100) are weirdly suppressed, due to the way visible
tiles are guestimated (i could not find a simple way to do better).
Maybe it can be worked around by adjusting one constant (scale3d ...)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the &quot;New Game&quot; screen, you either select a scenario and then
</I>&gt;<i> click start or you click on one of five texts below the scenario
</I>&gt;<i> list. Each starts the game instantly. I'd like to change that to
</I>&gt;<i> select and click start in all cases.
</I>yes.

&gt;<i> Are the three &quot;New random land&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> ready for release, or are they just for testing?
</I>I need to do some parameter tuning (desert is not desert enought,
temperate is too dry, wetland has often too much water)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;Options&quot; menu contains a &quot;resolution&quot; selector which offers
</I>&gt;<i> lots of resolutions. All but 1024x768 are not really well tested,
</I>&gt;<i> some of them are way to small to be useful, most of the are
</I>&gt;<i> strange. 896x672? Maybe on some laptop. While all other options are
</I>&gt;<i> applied at once, resolution is changed after pressing &quot;ok&quot;. If I
</I>&gt;<i> select a resolution not in that list by command line that will be
</I>&gt;<i> the only option in the menu. Leave it as is, remove it for now? A
</I>&gt;<i> list with hardcoded &quot;useful&quot; resolution won't work given the number
</I>&gt;<i> of different screen formats.
</I>I tested various screen resolutions from command line in window mode
(800x600 for debugging, 1800x1000 to play, 640x480 to test)

What is the smallest screen we want to be playable ?
Btw, i dont lke too much the current layout of the interface, i prefer
the old-lincity layout wiht more visible information at once.
I am currently having fun with gimp and try to draw a playable interface
for 640x400 (maybe for next release not this one)
I tried to upload it as a patch : 
<A HREF="https://developer.berlios.de/patch/index.php?func=detailpatch&amp;patch_id=2945&amp;group_id=2929">https://developer.berlios.de/patch/index.php?func=detailpatch&amp;patch_id=2945&amp;group_id=2929</A>

I m not sure it worked :(. This berlios interface is too ugly, is there a
chance to have trac or redmine or some kind of recent and decent project
management tool on berlios (also firefox refuses to connect me due to 
obsolete/wrong security certificate)

Cheers,
Alain


PS :  
&gt;<i> Bye,
</I>this sounds weird to me (non english native speaker) i feel like you are going
to leave us, i hope this is not the case.
