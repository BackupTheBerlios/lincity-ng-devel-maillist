<PRE>I just had an idea. The game is nice, the graphics are nice. Theres alot 
of work i can do, but i only have a mouse and i dont think i can sum up 
the cash for anything else until at least the end of the month. I'm 
suprisingly good at fine-tuning stuff, since i spent alot of hours in 
image manipulation.

There is no need to to put my name in credits for the two little things 
i did. Dangit, i mean it, it aint enough to bother people with. I'll be 
around, but this mouse is driving me insane. It's just too much work 
without one of those draw pads... though it is a bugger fine thing for 
photo altering.

And if there is a new lin city coming, well, dont let me get in the way. 
It'll be nice.

And the old work has alot of character. and alot of time into it. And 
mine is too depressing.


But in good news, ive been tinkering around in some source code and im 
improving in programming skill. That i dont need a draw pad for.


I'll be around. Happy to help if i can.
