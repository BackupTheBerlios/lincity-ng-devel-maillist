<PRE>The old artist liked his work, and alot of work it was. It's seems 
questionable to go in and replace his work.

There is still some work I can do one way or another. The coal mine 
still looks like butt, and the heavy industry needs to be less painful 
to look at, though removing the speckles in favor of something less 
cartoonishly evil again is one of those questionable things..

Probably for the best. Coal is something that I love dearly. I have a 
chunk of common-grade soft coal ten feet from me right now, and I'm 
planning on getting some for blacksmithing instead of wasting half a 
tree making a few hours of fuel.

I'll try not to make it clash.

But frankly, the trimmed, but naturaly yellowed, grass under the statue 
of Tux suits it well.

The previous artist's style, referring to the lower-tech buildings 
without doubt, is one that often needs his resources. His grass texture 
at the least. It can of course be worked around the hard way, but you 
may find that a bit of an ugly job.

With Minecraft back up, I've been a bit distracted. Greatest game ever.
