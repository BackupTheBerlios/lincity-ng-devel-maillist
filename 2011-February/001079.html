<PRE>Hello,

2011/2/2 Brandon Evans &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/lincity-ng-devel">coal87 at hotmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> The old artist liked his work, and alot of work it was. It's seems
</I>&gt;<i> questionable to go in and replace his work.
</I>I'm fine with that :) It's an open-source game after all. The sprites
currently in the game and at the SVN repo are mostly done by me. Some
older buildings are drawn by other artists. I've been drawing sprites
for Lincity-NG for 1,5 year or so, and that's why the sprites differ
in quality and style. Some older buildings look a bit crappy compared
to the newer ones. I haven't been drawing stuff for this game during
the last months, mainly because of my busy life and other projects.
The latest building I drew for this game was the coal power plant.

&gt;<i> There is still some work I can do one way or another. The coal mine still
</I>&gt;<i> looks like butt, and the heavy industry needs to be less painful to look at,
</I>&gt;<i> though removing the speckles in favor of something less cartoonishly evil
</I>&gt;<i> again is one of those questionable things..
</I>The coal mine is very old and could definitely use a better sprite.
Other buildings that could use some work are the rocket platform and
the market. I drew two newer versions of the market building in the
past: a low-tech one, and a modern looking market. They aren't used
yet, because I couldn't find a coder to implement them in the game.

&gt;<i> Probably for the best. Coal is something that I love dearly. I have a chunk
</I>&gt;<i> of common-grade soft coal ten feet from me right now, and I'm planning on
</I>&gt;<i> getting some for blacksmithing instead of wasting half a tree making a few
</I>&gt;<i> hours of fuel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll try not to make it clash.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But frankly, the trimmed, but naturally yellowed, grass under the statue of
</I>&gt;<i> Tux suits it well.
</I>The grass you used in this render looks very nice:

It's easier on the eyes than the particle grass I've been using for my
buildings. However, it is a lot of work to implement a new grass
texture in Lincity, because you will have to re-render all the
buildings with the new grass.

That tree behind the cottage doesn't really fit the grass, maybe you
could use a real picture of a tree instead? I think that would look
better.

&gt;<i> The previous artist's style, referring to the lower-tech buildings without
</I>&gt;<i> doubt, is one that often needs his resources. His grass texture at the
</I>&gt;<i> least. It can of course be worked around the hard way, but you may find that
</I>&gt;<i> a bit of an ugly job.
</I>I don't really understand what you're saying here, but that could just
be my bad English-knowledge ;)

Greetings,
Ivar
