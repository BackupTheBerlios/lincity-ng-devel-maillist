Hi Ivar, Brandon

nice to see you are still here Ivar :-)

Just some remarks:
- I think there is a script for launching all blender drawings, maybe 
wolfgang can confirm/deny this. I'll check this asap.

- i really liked Ivar low tech markets and wish to include them. I am 
thinking of the possibility to have several &quot;skins&quot; for the game :
   - the existing iso 3d occidental  (maybe with tech variations)
   - it would be wondeful to have a totaly different look, for example
	- cartoon like
	- asian (with bamboo and pagode-like roof ...)
   but as i am really bad at drawing this is just a dream for me.

- It is not mandatory to use blender for the drawing, just use your
favorite tools as the game needs images, not blender models.

Cheers
Alain

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2011/2/2 Brandon Evans&lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/lincity-ng-devel">coal87 at hotmail.com</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The old artist liked his work, and alot of work it was. It's seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> questionable to go in and replace his work.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm fine with that :) It's an open-source game after all. The sprites
</I>&gt;<i> currently in the game and at the SVN repo are mostly done by me. Some
</I>&gt;<i> older buildings are drawn by other artists. I've been drawing sprites
</I>&gt;<i> for Lincity-NG for 1,5 year or so, and that's why the sprites differ
</I>&gt;<i> in quality and style. Some older buildings look a bit crappy compared
</I>&gt;<i> to the newer ones. I haven't been drawing stuff for this game during
</I>&gt;<i> the last months, mainly because of my busy life and other projects.
</I>&gt;<i> The latest building I drew for this game was the coal power plant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is still some work I can do one way or another. The coal mine still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> looks like butt, and the heavy industry needs to be less painful to look at,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though removing the speckles in favor of something less cartoonishly evil
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> again is one of those questionable things..
</I>&gt;<i> The coal mine is very old and could definitely use a better sprite.
</I>&gt;<i> Other buildings that could use some work are the rocket platform and
</I>&gt;<i> the market. I drew two newer versions of the market building in the
</I>&gt;<i> past: a low-tech one, and a modern looking market. They aren't used
</I>&gt;<i> yet, because I couldn't find a coder to implement them in the game.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Probably for the best. Coal is something that I love dearly. I have a chunk
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of common-grade soft coal ten feet from me right now, and I'm planning on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> getting some for blacksmithing instead of wasting half a tree making a few
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hours of fuel.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'll try not to make it clash.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But frankly, the trimmed, but naturally yellowed, grass under the statue of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Tux suits it well.
</I>&gt;<i> The grass you used in this render looks very nice:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://garr.dl.sourceforge.net/project/redsands/lincity_data/Previews/LTM_pro_prev.png.">http://garr.dl.sourceforge.net/project/redsands/lincity_data/Previews/LTM_pro_prev.png.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> It's easier on the eyes than the particle grass I've been using for my
</I>&gt;<i> buildings. However, it is a lot of work to implement a new grass
</I>&gt;<i> texture in Lincity, because you will have to re-render all the
</I>&gt;<i> buildings with the new grass.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That tree behind the cottage doesn't really fit the grass, maybe you
</I>&gt;<i> could use a real picture of a tree instead? I think that would look
</I>&gt;<i> better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The previous artist's style, referring to the lower-tech buildings without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doubt, is one that often needs his resources. His grass texture at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least. It can of course be worked around the hard way, but you may find that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a bit of an ugly job.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't really understand what you're saying here, but that could just
</I>&gt;<i> be my bad English-knowledge ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Greetings,
</I>&gt;<i> Ivar
