<PRE>Hello,

The classic and modern market sprites are still on my computer, so I
can give them to you if you want to code them. It is confusing that
some buildings look the same at different tech levels. For axample,
the waterwell doesn't fit the modern ages at all, both technically and
visually. This just looks weird when one tries to build a realistic
city. It is also confusing that one needs to build classical water
wells in a modern city with modern factories and towers.

&gt;<i> - i really liked Ivar low tech markets and wish to include them. I am
</I>&gt;<i> thinking of the possibility to have several &quot;skins&quot; for the game :
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- the existing iso 3d occidental &#160;(maybe with tech variations)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- it would be wondeful to have a totaly different look, for example
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;- cartoon like
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;- asian (with bamboo and pagode-like roof ...)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;but as i am really bad at drawing this is just a dream for me.
</I>Skins would be cool, but for now I think it is better to make one
graphics set with buildings that fit each other. So that all buildings
have the same style at a specific tech level.

Greetings,
Ivar
