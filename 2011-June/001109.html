<PRE>Bug #15310, was updated on 2009-Feb-24 01:31
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: LinCityNG
Category: confirmed
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: mqawasmi
Assigned to : none
Summary: waste showing negative value in markets and recycling center

Details: I am playing LinCityNG v2.0 on windows. Recycling centers store is 100%, so it is not converting any waste into ore, the result is more waste in the markets. After some time, the percentage of waste in the markets and recycling centers became negative, so for example some markets has -25000% waste !!! Seems some counter needs to be of a longer type, and also the logic of the market burning waste at some point is not acting correctly.

I tried to fix the problem by selling all ore/steel/goods, but this didn't work, and the pollution is filling the city now.

I have a saved game, please let me know where to load it or if I should send it by e-mail

Thanks

I have a similar problem on Linux; My markets are not full yet but recycling centers don't work, except one; no way to make another one to work.

I run the game in french. You can find my savegame here: <A HREF="http://www.filehosting.org/file/details/238068/2_Y00661_Tech056_Cash_017M_P07662">http://www.filehosting.org/file/details/238068/2_Y00661_Tech056_Cash_017M_P07662</A>

I am having a similar problem under linux.  Recycle centers are showing plenty of ore and waste but output soon drops to zero and waste proliferates.  Job market in neighborhood is healthy so this is not due to a lack of available labor.  - George
