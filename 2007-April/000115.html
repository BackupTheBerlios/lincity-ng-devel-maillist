<PRE>Hello dear lincity-ng folks.

I just created a new branch &quot;waterwell&quot; for trying to implement some kind
of water management into lincity-ng, corresponding to
<A HREF="http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Wish_list#Water">http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Wish_list#Water</A> 

There was a wish for water pipes, i added (yes it's me ;) :

&quot;Water is one pilar of (sustanable) development and a real problem in real
life for billions of people. Maybe adding simplified water management is
possible:

    * Water availability can be computed from the initial map, 
	from shortest distance to navigable water. 
	Area without water should be yellow-brown like desert.
    * new building = well/water station (with a range) for farms and people,
	 and a water quality (from drinkable to mortal). Areas without water
	 would need high-tech deep well and/or pipes to feed the water station.
    * industry also need water (connection needed, pipes?), and can pollute it.
    * park along a river or around a well will also reduce the pollution.
    * pollution transported by river will follow the flow, so travel toward the
	 bottom of the map (roughtly opposite of wind direction :-)
&quot;

I expect to mess-up some times, and progress slowly (some monthes are needed).
I would like to follow bazaar development rules: &quot;release early, release often&quot;
but want to keep the branch compilable.

It will break compatibility, this should be addressed cleanly later
(need to modify save/load...).

Your comments/questions/help/code/images/sounds... are welcome.
Cheers.
Alain
