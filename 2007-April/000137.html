<PRE>Bug #5320, was updated on 2005-Oct-11 06:35
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: LinCityNG
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None

Summary: Just crashes on FreeBSD-5.4

Details: I'll be playing the game, and all of a sudden it just crashes, and goes back to the Window Manager on FreeBSD-5.4-RELEASE-p7 using KDE 3.4.1/Xorg 6.8.2. I ran it from an xterm to see what the error was, it's not very informative, but maybe it'll help. 

here's on run on gdb while trying to load a previous game:

It seems to be fixed, for 1.0.3 and 1.1.0.

Comment:
So Lincity-NG compiles with BSD too?  Nice work, any problems porting it? Sorry, no idea why it is not working, maybe you could recompile it
again with debug mode enabled? (configure --enable-debug)
That might produce some more hints.
